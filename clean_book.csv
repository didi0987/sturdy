"1","It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession",1,1
"2","of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.",2,1
"3","However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his",3,1
"4","first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds",4,1
"5","of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful",5,1
"6","property of some one or other of their daughters.",6,1
"7","""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" said his lady to him one day, ""have you heard that",7,1
"8","Netherfield Park is let at last?""",8,1
"9","Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.",9,1
"10","""But it is,"" returned she; ""for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she",10,1
"11","told me all about it.""",11,1
"12","Mr. Bennet made no answer.",12,1
"13","""Do not you want to know who has taken it?"" cried his wife impatiently.",13,1
"14","""_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.""",14,1
"15","This was invitation enough.",15,1
"16","""Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken",16,1
"17","by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came",17,1
"18","down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much",18,1
"19","delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is",19,1
"20","to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be",20,1
"21","in the house by the end of next week.""",21,1
"22","""What is his name?""",22,1
"23","""Bingley.""",23,1
"24","""Is he married or single?""",24,1
"25","""Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four",25,1
"26","or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!""",26,1
"27","""How so? how can it affect them?""",27,1
"28","""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" replied his wife, ""how can you be so tiresome! You",28,1
"29","must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""",29,1
"30","""Is that his design in settling here?""",30,1
"31","""Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he",31,1
"32","_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as",32,1
"33","soon as he comes.""",33,1
"34","""I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send",34,1
"35","them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are",35,1
"36","as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the",36,1
"37","party.""",37,1
"38","""My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but",38,1
"39","I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has",39,1
"40","five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own",40,1
"41","beauty.""",41,1
"42","""In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.""",42,1
"43","""But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into",43,1
"44","the neighbourhood.""",44,1
"45","""It is more than I engage for, I assure you.""",45,1
"46","""But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would",46,1
"47","be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,",47,1
"48","merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new",48,1
"49","comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit",49,1
"50","him, if you do not.""",50,1
"51","""You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very",51,1
"52","glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my",52,1
"53","hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though",53,1
"54","I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.""",54,1
"55","""I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the",55,1
"56","others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so",56,1
"57","good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the",57,1
"58","preference.""",58,1
"59","""They have none of them much to recommend them,"" replied he; ""they are",59,1
"60","all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of",60,1
"61","quickness than her sisters.""",61,1
"62","""Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take",62,1
"63","delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.""",63,1
"64","""You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They",64,1
"65","are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration",65,1
"66","these twenty years at least.""",66,1
"67","""Ah! you do not know what I suffer.""",67,1
"68","""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four",68,1
"69","thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.""",69,1
"70","""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not",70,1
"71","visit them.""",71,1
"72","""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them",72,1
"73","all.""",73,1
"74","Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,",74,1
"75","reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had",75,1
"76","been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind",76,1
"77","was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,",77,1
"78","little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she",78,1
"79","fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her",79,1
"80","daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.",80,1
"81","Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He",81,2
"82","had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his",82,2
"83","wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was",83,2
"84","paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following",84,2
"85","manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he",85,2
"86","suddenly addressed her with,",86,2
"87","""I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.""",87,2
"88","""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"" said her mother",88,2
"89","resentfully, ""since we are not to visit.""",89,2
"90","""But you forget, mama,"" said Elizabeth, ""that we shall meet him at the",90,2
"91","assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.""",91,2
"92","""I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces",92,2
"93","of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion",93,2
"94","of her.""",94,2
"95","""No more have I,"" said Mr. Bennet; ""and I am glad to find that you do",95,2
"96","not depend on her serving you.""",96,2
"97","Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain",97,2
"98","herself, began scolding one of her daughters.",98,2
"99","""Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little",99,2
"100","compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.""",100,2
"101","""Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,"" said her father; ""she times",101,2
"102","them ill.""",102,2
"103","""I do not cough for my own amusement,"" replied Kitty fretfully.",103,2
"104","""When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?""",104,2
"105","""To-morrow fortnight.""",105,2
"106","""Aye, so it is,"" cried her mother, ""and Mrs. Long does not come back",106,2
"107","till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,",107,2
"108","for she will not know him herself.""",108,2
"109","""Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce",109,2
"110","Mr. Bingley to _her_.""",110,2
"111","""Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him",111,2
"112","myself; how can you be so teazing?""",112,2
"113","""I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly",113,2
"114","very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a",114,2
"115","fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after",115,2
"116","all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as",116,2
"117","she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will",117,2
"118","take it on myself.""",118,2
"119","The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, ""Nonsense,",119,2
"120","nonsense!""",120,2
"121","""What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"" cried he. ""Do",121,2
"122","you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on",122,2
"123","them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,",123,2
"124","Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great",124,2
"125","books, and make extracts.""",125,2
"126","Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.",126,2
"127","""While Mary is adjusting her ideas,"" he continued, ""let us return to Mr.",127,2
"128","Bingley.""",128,2
"129","""I am sick of Mr. Bingley,"" cried his wife.",129,2
"130","""I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I",130,2
"131","had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on",131,2
"132","him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we",132,2
"133","cannot escape the acquaintance now.""",133,2
"134","The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.",134,2
"135","Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy",135,2
"136","was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the",136,2
"137","while.",137,2
"138","""How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should",138,2
"139","persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to",139,2
"140","neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a",140,2
"141","good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said",141,2
"142","a word about it till now.""",142,2
"143","""Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,"" said Mr. Bennet; and,",143,2
"144","as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",144,2
"145","""What an excellent father you have, girls,"" said she, when the door was",145,2
"146","shut. ""I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;",146,2
"147","or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so",147,2
"148","pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but",148,2
"149","for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you _are_",149,2
"150","the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next",150,2
"151","ball.""",151,2
"152","""Oh!"" said Lydia stoutly, ""I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the",152,2
"153","youngest, I'm the tallest.""",153,2
"154","The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would",154,2
"155","return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to",155,2
"156","dinner.",156,2
"157","Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five",157,3
"158","daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her",158,3
"159","husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him",159,3
"160","in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and",160,3
"161","distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at",161,3
"162","last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour",162,3
"163","Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been",163,3
"164","delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely",164,3
"165","agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly",165,3
"166","with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of",166,3
"167","dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively",167,3
"168","hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.",168,3
"169","""If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,""",169,3
"170","said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, ""and all the others equally well",170,3
"171","married, I shall have nothing to wish for.""",171,3
"172","In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten",172,3
"173","minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being",173,3
"174","admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard",174,3
"175","much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more",175,3
"176","fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper",176,3
"177","window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.",177,3
"178","An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had",178,3
"179","Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her",179,3
"180","housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley",180,3
"181","was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to",181,3
"182","accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite",182,3
"183","disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town",183,3
"184","so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that",184,3
"185","he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never",185,3
"186","settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a",186,3
"187","little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a",187,3
"188","large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley",188,3
"189","was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.",189,3
"190","The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the",190,3
"191","day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought",191,3
"192","only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when",192,3
"193","the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five",193,3
"194","altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and",194,3
"195","another young man.",195,3
"196","Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant",196,3
"197","countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,",197,3
"198","with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely",198,3
"199","looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention",199,3
"200","of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and",200,3
"201","the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after",201,3
"202","his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen",202,3
"203","pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was",203,3
"204","much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great",204,3
"205","admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust",205,3
"206","which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be",206,3
"207","proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his",207,3
"208","large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most",208,3
"209","forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared",209,3
"210","with his friend.",210,3
"211","Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal",211,3
"212","people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,",212,3
"213","was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one",213,3
"214","himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for",214,3
"215","themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced",215,3
"216","only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being",216,3
"217","introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in",217,3
"218","walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.",218,3
"219","His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in",219,3
"220","the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.",220,3
"221","Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of",221,3
"222","his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his",222,3
"223","having slighted one of her daughters.",223,3
"224","Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit",224,3
"225","down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been",225,3
"226","standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and",226,3
"227","Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his",227,3
"228","friend to join it.",228,3
"229","""Come, Darcy,"" said he, ""I must have you dance. I hate to see you",229,3
"230","standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better",230,3
"231","dance.""",231,3
"232","""I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am",232,3
"233","particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it",233,3
"234","would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not",234,3
"235","another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to",235,3
"236","stand up with.""",236,3
"237","""I would not be so fastidious as you are,"" cried Bingley, ""for a",237,3
"238","kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my",238,3
"239","life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see",239,3
"240","uncommonly pretty.""",240,3
"241","""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"" said Mr.",241,3
"242","Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.",242,3
"243","""Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one",243,3
"244","of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I",244,3
"245","dare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.""",245,3
"246","""Which do you mean?"" and turning round, he looked for a moment at",246,3
"247","Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,",247,3
"248","""She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no",248,3
"249","humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted",249,3
"250","by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her",250,3
"251","smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.""",251,3
"252","Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth",252,3
"253","remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story",253,3
"254","however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,",254,3
"255","playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.",255,3
"256","The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.",256,3
"257","Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield",257,3
"258","party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been",258,3
"259","distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her",259,3
"260","mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's",260,3
"261","pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most",261,3
"262","accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been",262,3
"263","fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they",263,3
"264","had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good",264,3
"265","spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they",265,3
"266","were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a",266,3
"267","book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a",267,3
"268","good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised",268,3
"269","such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife's",269,3
"270","views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he",270,3
"271","had a very different story to hear.",271,3
"272","""Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,"" as she entered the room, ""we have had a most",272,3
"273","delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.",273,3
"274","Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well",274,3
"275","she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with",275,3
"276","her twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her",276,3
"277","twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second",277,3
"278","time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand",278,3
"279","up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody",279,3
"280","can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going",280,3
"281","down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and",281,3
"282","asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss",282,3
"283","King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane",283,3
"284","again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----""",284,3
"285","""If he had had any compassion for _me_,"" cried her husband impatiently,",285,3
"286","""he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of",286,3
"287","his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!""",287,3
"288","""Oh! my dear,"" continued Mrs. Bennet, ""I am quite delighted with him. He",288,3
"289","is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never",289,3
"290","in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the",290,3
"291","lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown----""",291,3
"292","Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any",292,3
"293","description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch",293,3
"294","of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some",294,3
"295","exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.",295,3
"296","""But I can assure you,"" she added, ""that Lizzy does not lose much by not",296,3
"297","suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at",297,3
"298","all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring",298,3
"299","him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very",299,3
"300","great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my",300,3
"301","dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.""",301,3
"302","When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in",302,4
"303","her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much",303,4
"304","she admired him.",304,4
"305","""He is just what a young man ought to be,"" said she, ""sensible, good",305,4
"306","humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,",306,4
"307","with such perfect good breeding!""",307,4
"308","""He is also handsome,"" replied Elizabeth, ""which a young man ought",308,4
"309","likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.""",309,4
"310","""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I",310,4
"311","did not expect such a compliment.""",311,4
"312","""Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between",312,4
"313","us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What",313,4
"314","could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help",314,4
"315","seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in",315,4
"316","the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is",316,4
"317","very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a",317,4
"318","stupider person.""",318,4
"319","""Dear Lizzy!""",319,4
"320","""Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.",320,4
"321","You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable",321,4
"322","in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.""",322,4
"323","""I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak",323,4
"324","what I think.""",324,4
"325","""I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_",325,4
"326","good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of",326,4
"327","others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every",327,4
"328","where. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good",328,4
"329","of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of",329,4
"330","the bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man's sisters too,",330,4
"331","do you? Their manners are not equal to his.""",331,4
"332","""Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you",332,4
"333","converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep",333,4
"334","his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming",334,4
"335","neighbour in her.""",335,4
"336","Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at",336,4
"337","the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more",337,4
"338","quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and",338,4
"339","with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very",339,4
"340","little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not",340,4
"341","deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of",341,4
"342","being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were",342,4
"343","rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private",343,4
"344","seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the",344,4
"345","habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people",345,4
"346","of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of",346,4
"347","themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in",347,4
"348","the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their",348,4
"349","memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been",349,4
"350","acquired by trade.",350,4
"351","Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred",351,4
"352","thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,",352,4
"353","but did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and",353,4
"354","sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a",354,4
"355","good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those",355,4
"356","who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the",356,4
"357","remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to",357,4
"358","purchase.",358,4
"359","His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but",359,4
"360","though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no",360,4
"361","means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had",361,4
"362","married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider",362,4
"363","his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of",363,4
"364","age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to",364,4
"365","look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an",365,4
"366","hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied",366,4
"367","with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.",367,4
"368","Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a",368,4
"369","great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the",369,4
"370","easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could",370,4
"371","offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never",371,4
"372","appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the",372,4
"373","firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In",373,4
"374","understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,",374,4
"375","but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and",375,4
"376","fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In",376,4
"377","that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of",377,4
"378","being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.",378,4
"379","The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently",379,4
"380","characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier",380,4
"381","girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,",381,4
"382","there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted",382,4
"383","with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel",383,4
"384","more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people",384,4
"385","in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had",385,4
"386","felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or",386,4
"387","pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too",387,4
"388","much.",388,4
"389","Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired",389,4
"390","her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom",390,4
"391","they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore",391,4
"392","established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such",392,4
"393","commendation to think of her as he chose.",393,4
"394","Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets",394,5
"395","were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade",395,5
"396","in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the",396,5
"397","honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.",397,5
"398","The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a",398,5
"399","disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and",399,5
"400","quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a",400,5
"401","mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he",401,5
"402","could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by",402,5
"403","business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For",403,5
"404","though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the",404,5
"405","contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,",405,5
"406","friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him",406,5
"407","courteous.",407,5
"408","Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a",408,5
"409","valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.--They had several children. The",409,5
"410","eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,",410,5
"411","was Elizabeth's intimate friend.",411,5
"412","That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a",412,5
"413","ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly",413,5
"414","brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.",414,5
"415","""_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,"" said Mrs. Bennet with civil",415,5
"416","self-command to Miss Lucas. ""_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.""",416,5
"417","""Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better.""",417,5
"418","""Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice. To be",418,5
"419","sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he",419,5
"420","_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something",420,5
"421","about Mr. Robinson.""",421,5
"422","""Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not",422,5
"423","I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton",423,5
"424","assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty",424,5
"425","women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his",425,5
"426","answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet",426,5
"427","beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.""",427,5
"428","""Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as",428,5
"429","if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know.""",429,5
"430","""_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,"" said",430,5
"431","Charlotte. ""Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,",431,5
"432","is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.""",432,5
"433","""I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his",433,5
"434","ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite",434,5
"435","a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he",435,5
"436","sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.""",436,5
"437","""Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"" said",437,5
"438","Jane.--""I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.""",438,5
"439","""Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he",439,5
"440","could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at",440,5
"441","being spoke to.""",441,5
"442","""Miss Bingley told me,"" said Jane, ""that he never speaks much unless",442,5
"443","among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably",443,5
"444","agreeable.""",444,5
"445","""I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very",445,5
"446","agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was;",446,5
"447","every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had",447,5
"448","heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to",448,5
"449","the ball in a hack chaise.""",449,5
"450","""I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,"" said Miss Lucas, ""but I",450,5
"451","wish he had danced with Eliza.""",451,5
"452","""Another time, Lizzy,"" said her mother, ""I would not dance with _him_,",452,5
"453","if I were you.""",453,5
"454","""I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.""",454,5
"455","""His pride,"" said Miss Lucas, ""does not offend _me_ so much as pride",455,5
"456","often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so",456,5
"457","very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,",457,5
"458","should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_",458,5
"459","to be proud.""",459,5
"460","""That is very true,"" replied Elizabeth, ""and I could easily forgive",460,5
"461","_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.""",461,5
"462","""Pride,"" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her",462,5
"463","reflections, ""is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have",463,5
"464","ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human",464,5
"465","nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us",465,5
"466","who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some",466,5
"467","quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different",467,5
"468","things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be",468,5
"469","proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of",469,5
"470","ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""",470,5
"471","""If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,"" cried a young Lucas who came with his",471,5
"472","sisters, ""I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of",472,5
"473","foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.""",473,5
"474","""Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,"" said Mrs.",474,5
"475","Bennet; ""and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle",475,5
"476","directly.""",476,5
"477","The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she",477,5
"478","would, and the argument ended only with the visit.",478,5
"479","The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit",479,6
"480","was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the",480,6
"481","good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was",481,6
"482","found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a",482,6
"483","wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the",483,6
"484","two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest",484,6
"485","pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of",485,6
"486","every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;",486,6
"487","though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in",487,6
"488","all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was",488,6
"489","generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to",489,6
"490","_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference",490,6
"491","which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a",491,6
"492","way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it",492,6
"493","was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane",493,6
"494","united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a",494,6
"495","uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the",495,6
"496","suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss",496,6
"497","Lucas.",497,6
"498","""It may perhaps be pleasant,"" replied Charlotte, ""to be able to impose",498,6
"499","on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be",499,6
"500","so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill",500,6
"501","from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and",501,6
"502","it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the",502,6
"503","dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every",503,6
"504","attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all",504,6
"505","_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are",505,6
"506","very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without",506,6
"507","encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_",507,6
"508","affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he",508,6
"509","may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.""",509,6
"510","""But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can",510,6
"511","perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to",511,6
"512","discover it too.""",512,6
"513","""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.""",513,6
"514","""But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal",514,6
"515","it, he must find it out.""",515,6
"516","""Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane",516,6
"517","meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they",517,6
"518","always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that",518,6
"519","every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should",519,6
"520","therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his",520,6
"521","attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling",521,6
"522","in love as much as she chuses.""",522,6
"523","""Your plan is a good one,"" replied Elizabeth, ""where nothing is in",523,6
"524","question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined",524,6
"525","to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But",525,6
"526","these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she",526,6
"527","cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its",527,6
"528","reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four",528,6
"529","dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,",529,6
"530","and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite",530,6
"531","enough to make her understand his character.""",531,6
"532","""Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might",532,6
"533","only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must",533,6
"534","remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four",534,6
"535","evenings may do a great deal.""",535,6
"536","""Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both",536,6
"537","like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other",537,6
"538","leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.""",538,6
"539","""Well,"" said Charlotte, ""I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if",539,6
"540","she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a",540,6
"541","chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a",541,6
"542","twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If",542,6
"543","the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or",543,6
"544","ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the",544,6
"545","least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to",545,6
"546","have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as",546,6
"547","possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your",547,6
"548","life.""",548,6
"549","""You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not",549,6
"550","sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.""",550,6
"551","Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth",551,6
"552","was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some",552,6
"553","interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely",553,6
"554","allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the",554,6
"555","ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no",555,6
"556","sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had",556,6
"557","hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered",557,6
"558","uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To",558,6
"559","this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had",559,6
"560","detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry",560,6
"561","in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and",561,6
"562","pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those",562,6
"563","of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of",563,6
"564","this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made",564,6
"565","himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough",565,6
"566","to dance with.",566,6
"567","He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing",567,6
"568","with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so",568,6
"569","drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were",569,6
"570","assembled.",570,6
"571","""What does Mr. Darcy mean,"" said she to Charlotte, ""by listening to my",571,6
"572","conversation with Colonel Forster?""",572,6
"573","""That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.""",573,6
"574","""But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see",574,6
"575","what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by",575,6
"576","being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.""",576,6
"577","On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have",577,6
"578","any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such",578,6
"579","a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she",579,6
"580","turned to him and said,",580,6
"581","""Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well",581,6
"582","just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at",582,6

"584","""With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady",584,6

"586","""You are severe on us.""",586,6

"607","had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with",607,6
"608","much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the",608,6
"609","end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by",609,6
"610","Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with",610,6
"611","some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing",611,6
"612","at one end of the room.",612,6
"613","Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of",613,6
"614","passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too",614,6
"615","much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas",615,6
"616","was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.",616,6
"617","""What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!--There",617,6

"620","""Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue",620,6
"621","amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can",621,6
"622","dance.""",622,6
"623","Sir William only smiled. ""Your friend performs delightfully;"" he",623,6
"624","continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--""and I doubt",624,6
"625","not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.""",625,6
"626","""You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir.""",626,6
"627","""Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do",627,6
"628","you often dance at St. James's?""",628,6
"629","""Never, sir.""",629,6
"630","""Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?""",630,6
"631","""It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.""",631,6
"632","""You have a house in town, I conclude?""",632,6
"633","Mr. Darcy bowed.",633,6
"634","""I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of",634,6
"635","superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of",635,6
"636","London would agree with Lady Lucas.""",636,6
"637","He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to",637,6
"638","make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was",638,6
"639","struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to",639,6

"641","""My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr. Darcy, you must allow",641,6

"658","cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a",658,6
"659","partner?""",659,6
"660","Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not",660,6
"661","injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some",661,6

"670","""Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more",670,6

"672","which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.""",672,6
"673","Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he",673,6
"674","would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.",674,6
"675","Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,",675,6
"676","""Miss Elizabeth Bennet.""",676,6
"677","""Miss Elizabeth Bennet!"" repeated Miss Bingley. ""I am all astonishment.",677,6

"679","joy?""",679,6
"680","""That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's",680,6
"681","imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love",681,6

"683","""Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as",683,6

"686","He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to",686,6
"687","entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her",687,6
"688","that all was safe, her wit flowed long.",688,6
"689","Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two",689,7
"690","thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in",690,7
"691","default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's",691,7
"692","fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply",692,7
"693","the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and",693,7
"694","had left her four thousand pounds.",694,7
"695","She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their",695,7

"697","London in a respectable line of trade.",697,7
"698","The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most",698,7
"699","convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted",699,7
"700","thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and",700,7
"701","to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,",701,7
"702","Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;",702,7
"703","their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing",703,7
"704","better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning",704,7
"705","hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news",705,7
"706","the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some",706,7
"707","from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with",707,7
"708","news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the",708,7
"709","neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the",709,7
"710","head quarters.",710,7
"711","Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting",711,7
"712","intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the",712,7
"713","officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,",713,7
"714","and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips",714,7
"715","visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity",715,7
"716","unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.",716,7
"717","Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their",717,7
"718","mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of",718,7

"721","Bennet coolly observed,",721,7
"722","""From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two",722,7

"725","Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect",725,7

"728","next morning to London.",728,7
"729","""I am astonished, my dear,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""that you should be so",729,7

"731","of any body's children, it should not be of my own however.""",731,7
"732","""If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.""",732,7
"733","""Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.""",733,7

"783","day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it",783,7
"784","rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was",784,7

"830","over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within",830,7
"831","view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face",831,7
"832","glowing with the warmth of exercise.",832,7
"833","She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were",833,7
"834","assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of",834,7
"835","surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,",835,7
"836","in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.",836,7
"837","Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her",837,7
"838","in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them;",838,7
"839","and in their brother's manners there was something better than",839,7
"840","politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very",840,7
"841","little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between",841,7
"842","admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,",842,7
"843","and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The",843,7
"844","latter was thinking only of his breakfast.",844,7
"845","Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss",845,7
"846","Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well",846,7

"849","alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed",849,7
"850","for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,",850,7
"851","however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,",851,7
"852","could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the",852,7
"853","extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended",853,7
"854","her.",854,7
"855","When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth",855,7
"856","began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and",856,7
"857","solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having",857,7
"858","examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a",858,7
"859","violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;",859,7
"860","advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice",860,7
"861","was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head",861,7
"862","ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were",862,7
"863","the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact",863,7
"864","nothing to do elsewhere.",864,7
"865","When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very",865,7
"866","unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only",866,7
"867","wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern",867,7
"868","in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer",868,7
"869","of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the",869,7
"870","present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was",870,7
"871","dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring",871,7
"872","back a supply of clothes.",872,7
"873","At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six",873,8
"874","Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then",874,8
"875","poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the",875,8
"876","much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very",876,8
"877","favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing",877,8
"878","this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how",878,8
"879","shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked",879,8
"880","being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their",880,8
"881","indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored",881,8
"882","Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.",882,8
"883","Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could",883,8
"884","regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his",884,8
"885","attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling",885,8
"886","herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the",886,8
"887","others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was",887,8
"888","engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.",888,8
"889","Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to",889,8
"890","eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish",890,8
"891","to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.",891,8
"892","When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley",892,8
"893","began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were",893,8
"894","pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;",894,8
"895","she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst",895,8
"896","thought the same, and added,",896,8
"897","""She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent",897,8
"898","walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really",898,8
"899","looked almost wild.""",899,8
"900","""She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very",900,8
"901","nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the",901,8
"902","country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!""",902,8
"903","""Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep",903,8
"904","in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to",904,8
"905","hide it, not doing its office.""",905,8
"906","""Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,"" said Bingley; ""but this was",906,8
"907","all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably",907,8
"908","well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat",908,8
"909","quite escaped my notice.""",909,8
"910","""_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"" said Miss Bingley; ""and I am",910,8

"916","it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,",916,8
"917","a most country town indifference to decorum.""",917,8
"918","""It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,"" said",918,8
"919","Bingley.",919,8
"920","""I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,"" observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,",920,8
"921","""that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine",921,8
"922","eyes.""",922,8
"923","""Not at all,"" he replied; ""they were brightened by the exercise.""--A",923,8
"924","short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.",924,8
"925","""I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet",925,8
"926","girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such",926,8
"927","a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no",927,8
"928","chance of it.""",928,8
"929","""I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in",929,8

"931","""Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.""",931,8
"932","""That is capital,"" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.",932,8
"933","""If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,"" cried Bingley, ""it",933,8
"934","would not make them one jot less agreeable.""",934,8
"935","""But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any",935,8
"936","consideration in the world,"" replied Darcy.",936,8
"937","To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their",937,8
"938","hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of",938,8
"939","their dear friend's vulgar relations.",939,8
"940","With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on",940,8
"941","leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.",941,8
"942","She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till",942,8
"943","late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and",943,8
"944","when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go",944,8
"945","down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole",945,8
"946","party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting",946,8
"947","them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the",947,8
"948","excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay",948,8
"949","below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.",949,8
"950","""Do you prefer reading to cards?"" said he; ""that is rather singular.""",950,8
"951","""Miss Eliza Bennet,"" said Miss Bingley, ""despises cards. She is a great",951,8
"952","reader and has no pleasure in anything else.""",952,8
"953","""I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,"" cried Elizabeth; ""I am",953,8
"954","_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.""",954,8
"955","""In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,"" said Bingley; ""and",955,8
"956","I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.""",956,8
"957","Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table",957,8
"958","where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her",958,8

"960","""And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own",960,8

"962","than I ever look into.""",962,8
"963","Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those",963,8
"964","in the room.",964,8
"965","""I am astonished,"" said Miss Bingley, ""that my father should have left",965,8
"966","so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at",966,8

"973","these.""",973,8
"974","""Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of",974,8
"975","that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be",975,8
"976","half as delightful as Pemberley.""",976,8
"977","""I wish it may.""",977,8
"978","""But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that",978,8

"980","finer county in England than Derbyshire.""",980,8
"981","""With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.""",981,8
"982","""I am talking of possibilities, Charles.""",982,8
"983","""Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get",983,8
"984","Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.""",984,8
"985","Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little",985,8
"986","attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near",986,8
"987","the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest",987,8
"988","sister, to observe the game.",988,8
"989","""Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"" said Miss Bingley; ""will",989,8

"991","""I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or",991,8
"992","rather taller.""",992,8
"993","""How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me",993,8
"994","so much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely",994,8
"995","accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is",995,8
"996","exquisite.""",996,8
"997","""It is amazing to me,"" said Bingley, ""how young ladies can have patience",997,8

"999","""All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?""",999,8
"1000","""Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net",1000,8
"1001","purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I",1001,8
"1002","never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being",1002,8
"1003","informed that she was very accomplished.""",1003,8
"1004","""Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,"" said Darcy, ""has",1004,8
"1005","too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no",1005,8
"1006","otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very",1006,8
"1007","far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I",1007,8
"1008","cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my",1008,8
"1009","acquaintance, that are really accomplished.""",1009,8

"1016","with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,",1016,8
"1017","dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all",1017,8
"1018","this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of",1018,8

"1032","answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with",1032,8
"1033","bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all",1033,8

"1044","Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to",1044,8
"1045","continue the subject.",1045,8
"1046","Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and",1046,8
"1047","that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for",1047,8
"1048","immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could",1048,8
"1049","be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most",1049,8
"1050","eminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so",1050,8
"1051","unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled",1051,8
"1052","that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet",1052,8
"1053","were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters",1053,8
"1054","declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,",1054,8
"1055","however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to",1055,8
"1056","his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every",1056,8
"1057","possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.",1057,8
"1058","Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the",1058,9
"1059","morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the",1059,9
"1060","enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,",1060,9
"1061","and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his",1061,9
"1062","sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a",1062,9
"1063","note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her",1063,9
"1064","own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and",1064,9
"1065","its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her",1065,9
"1066","two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.",1066,9
"1067","Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been",1067,9
"1068","very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was",1068,9
"1069","not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her",1069,9
"1070","restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She",1070,9
"1071","would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried",1071,9
"1072","home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think",1072,9
"1073","it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss",1073,9
"1074","Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all",1074,9
"1075","attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes",1075,9
"1076","that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.",1076,9
"1077","""Indeed I have, Sir,"" was her answer. ""She is a great deal too ill to be",1077,9

"1089","always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest",1089,9

"1729","received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for",1729,13
"1730","their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,",1730,13

"1735","ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need",1735,13
"1736","of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,",1736,13
"1737","heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and",1737,13
"1738","stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated",1738,13
"1739","before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of",1739,13
"1740","daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this",1740,13

"1761","and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's",1761,13
"1762","heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his",1762,13

"1764","he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its",1764,13
"1765","cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured",1765,13
"1766","him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good",1766,13
"1767","cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged",1767,13
"1768","pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared",1768,13

"1774","shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady",1774,14
"1775","Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his",1775,14
"1776","comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen",1776,14
"1777","better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him",1777,14
"1778","to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect",1778,14
"1779","he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a",1779,14
"1780","person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself",1780,14
"1781","experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to",1781,14
"1782","approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of",1782,14
"1783","preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,",1783,14
"1784","and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of",1784,14
"1785","quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many",1785,14
"1786","people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.",1786,14
"1787","She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she",1787,14

"1789","neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or",1789,14
"1790","two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to",1790,14
"1791","marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had",1791,14
"1792","once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly",1792,14
"1793","approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed",1793,14

"2069","received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there",2069,16

"2071","determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,",2071,16
"2072","she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets",2072,16
"2073","and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in",2073,16
"2074","particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was",2074,16
"2075","therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to",2075,16
"2076","hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to",2076,16
"2077","be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not",2077,16
"2078","even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly",2078,16
"2079","relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far",2079,16
"2080","Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in",2080,16
"2081","an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.",2081,16
"2082","""About a month,"" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject",2082,16

"2093","""As much as I ever wish to be,"" cried Elizabeth warmly,--""I have spent",2093,16

"2107","interruption, ""that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond",2107,16
"2108","their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The",2108,16

"2115","""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I",2115,16

"2127","scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every",2127,16

"2436","pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this",2436,18

"2459","the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular",2459,18
"2460","notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;",2460,18

"2462","apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being",2462,18
"2463","aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable",2463,18
"2464","partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from",2464,18
"2465","him was ecstacy.",2465,18
"2466","She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of",2466,18
"2467","Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances",2467,18
"2468","were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with",2468,18
"2469","her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took",2469,18
"2470","her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without",2470,18
"2471","knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again",2471,18

"2493","the room, or the number of couples.""",2493,18
"2494","He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be",2494,18
"2495","said.",2495,18
"2496","""Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I",2496,18

"2499","""Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?""",2499,18
"2500","""Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be",2500,18
"2501","entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of",2501,18
"2502","_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the",2502,18
"2503","trouble of saying as little as possible.""",2503,18
"2504","""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you",2504,18
"2505","imagine that you are gratifying mine?""",2505,18
"2506","""Both,"" replied Elizabeth archly; ""for I have always seen a great",2506,18

"2508","taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say",2508,18

"2510","posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.""",2510,18
"2511","""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,""",2511,18

"2513","think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.""",2513,18
"2514","""I must not decide on my own performance.""",2514,18

"2517","walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist",2517,18

"2519","been forming a new acquaintance.""",2519,18
"2520","The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his",2520,18
"2521","features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself",2521,18
"2522","for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a",2522,18
"2523","constrained manner said,",2523,18
"2524","""Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his",2524,18

"2532","through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.",2532,18

"2588","silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for",2588,18
"2589","in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,",2589,18

"2598","late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,",2598,18
"2599","not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.",2599,18
"2600","Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he",2600,18
"2601","has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has",2601,18
"2602","treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the",2602,18
"2603","particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to",2603,18
"2604","blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that",2604,18
"2605","though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his",2605,18
"2606","invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had",2606,18
"2607","taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a",2607,18
"2608","most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.",2608,18

"2612","Elizabeth angrily; ""for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse",2612,18
"2613","than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can",2613,18
"2614","assure you, he informed me himself.""",2614,18

"2618","you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see",2618,18
"2619","nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.",2619,18
"2620","Darcy."" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make",2620,18
"2621","inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of",2621,18
"2622","such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently",2622,18
"2623","marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the",2623,18
"2624","evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment",2624,18
"2625","solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing",2625,18

"2627","happiness.",2627,18
"2628","""I want to know,"" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her",2628,18
"2629","sister's, ""what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have",2629,18

"2632","""No,"" replied Jane, ""I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing",2632,18

"2635","principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,",2635,18
"2636","the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that",2636,18
"2637","Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has",2637,18
"2638","received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his",2638,18
"2639","sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am",2639,18
"2640","afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's",2640,18

"2651","Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but",2651,18
"2652","since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt",2652,18
"2653","the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of",2653,18
"2654","both gentlemen as I did before.""",2654,18
"2655","She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on",2655,18

"2657","delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of",2657,18
"2658","Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence",2658,18
"2659","in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew",2659,18
"2660","to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last",2660,18
"2661","partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and",2661,18

"2667","this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother",2667,18

"2671","in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,",2671,18
"2672","and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total",2672,18

"2680","an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it",2680,18
"2681","was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either",2681,18
"2682","side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in",2682,18
"2683","consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her",2683,18
"2684","with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she",2684,18
"2685","ceased speaking, replied thus,",2685,18
"2686","""My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your",2686,18
"2687","excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your",2687,18
"2688","understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference",2688,18

"2690","which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider",2690,18
"2691","the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank",2691,18
"2692","in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the",2692,18

"2694","of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look",2694,18
"2695","on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your",2695,18
"2696","advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though",2696,18
"2697","in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and",2697,18
"2698","habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like",2698,18
"2699","yourself."" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose",2699,18
"2700","reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at",2700,18
"2701","being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with",2701,18
"2702","a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if",2702,18
"2703","hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words ""apology,""",2703,18
"2704","""Hunsford,"" and ""Lady Catherine de Bourgh.""--It vexed her to see him",2704,18
"2705","expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained",2705,18
"2706","wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied",2706,18
"2707","with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not",2707,18
"2708","discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed",2708,18
"2709","abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the",2709,18
"2710","end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.",2710,18

"2715","that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be",2715,18
"2716","certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very",2716,18
"2717","handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.""",2717,18
"2718","As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned",2718,18
"2719","her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the",2719,18
"2720","train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,",2720,18
"2721","made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in",2721,18
"2722","that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection",2722,18
"2723","could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of",2723,18
"2724","endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts",2724,18
"2725","she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to",2725,18
"2726","venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to",2726,18
"2727","supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which",2727,18
"2728","placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find",2728,18
"2729","that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,",2729,18
"2730","openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be",2730,18
"2731","soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.",2731,18
"2732","Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of",2732,18
"2733","the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living",2733,18
"2734","but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;",2734,18
"2735","and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of",2735,18
"2736","Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as",2736,18
"2737","she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger",2737,18
"2738","daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of",2738,18
"2739","other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be",2739,18
"2740","able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that",2740,18
"2741","she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was",2741,18
"2742","necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on",2742,18
"2743","such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.",2743,18
"2744","Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She",2744,18

"2750","whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the",2750,18
"2751","chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her",2751,18

"2758","so doing.""",2758,18
"2759","Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother",2759,18
"2760","would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed",2760,18
"2761","and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently",2761,18
"2762","glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what",2762,18
"2763","she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was",2763,18
"2764","convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression",2764,18
"2765","of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and",2765,18
"2766","steady gravity.",2766,18
"2767","At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who",2767,18
"2768","had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no",2768,18

"2771","tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she",2771,18
"2772","had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,",2772,18
"2773","preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent",2773,18
"2774","entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of",2774,18
"2775","complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an",2775,18
"2776","opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.",2776,18
"2777","Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she",2777,18
"2778","watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience",2778,18
"2779","which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving",2779,18
"2780","amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be",2780,18
"2781","prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute",2781,18
"2782","began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;",2782,18
"2783","her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.",2783,18
"2784","She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly",2784,18
"2785","talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making",2785,18
"2786","signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however",2786,18
"2787","impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his",2787,18
"2788","interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,",2788,18
"2789","and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,",2789,18
"2790","""That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.",2790,18
"2791","Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.""",2791,18
"2792","Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and",2792,18
"2793","Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid",2793,18
"2794","her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.",2794,18
"2795","""If I,"" said Mr. Collins, ""were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I",2795,18
"2796","should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an",2796,18
"2797","air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly",2797,18
"2798","compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to",2798,18
"2799","assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to",2799,18
"2800","music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The",2800,18
"2801","rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make",2801,18
"2802","such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not",2802,18
"2803","offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time",2803,18
"2804","that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care",2804,18
"2805","and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making",2805,18
"2806","as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance",2806,18
"2807","that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every",2807,18
"2808","body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot",2808,18
"2809","acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should",2809,18
"2810","omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected",2810,18
"2811","with the family."" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,",2811,18
"2812","which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many",2812,18
"2813","stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet",2813,18
"2814","himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having",2814,18
"2815","spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that",2815,18
"2816","he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.",2816,18
"2817","To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to",2817,18
"2818","expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would",2818,18
"2819","have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or",2819,18
"2820","finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister",2820,18
"2821","that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his",2821,18
"2822","feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he",2822,18
"2823","must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should",2823,18
"2824","have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and",2824,18
"2825","she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or",2825,18
"2826","the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.",2826,18
"2827","The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by",2827,18
"2828","Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he",2828,18
"2829","could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her",2829,18
"2830","power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with",2830,18
"2831","somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.",2831,18
"2832","He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;",2832,18
"2833","that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to",2833,18
"2834","her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her",2834,18
"2835","the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed",2835,18
"2836","her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and",2836,18
"2837","good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.",2837,18
"2838","She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;",2838,18
"2839","though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite",2839,18
"2840","disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the",2840,18
"2841","probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in",2841,18
"2842","it.",2842,18
"2843","The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a",2843,18
"2844","manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of",2844,18
"2845","an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how",2845,18
"2846","heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her",2846,18
"2847","sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and",2847,18
"2848","were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed",2848,18
"2849","every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a",2849,18
"2850","languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the",2850,18
"2851","long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his",2851,18
"2852","sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and",2852,18
"2853","politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said",2853,18
"2854","nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.",2854,18
"2855","Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the",2855,18
"2856","rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a",2856,18
"2857","silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too",2857,18
"2858","much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of ""Lord,",2858,18
"2859","how tired I am!"" accompanied by a violent yawn.",2859,18
"2860","When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly",2860,18
"2861","civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and",2861,18
"2862","addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy",2862,18
"2863","he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,",2863,18
"2864","without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful",2864,18
"2865","pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of",2865,18
"2866","waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to",2866,18
"2867","go the next day for a short time.",2867,18
"2868","Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the",2868,18
"2869","delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of",2869,18
"2870","settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly",2870,18
"2871","see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four",2871,18
"2872","months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought",2872,18
"2873","with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.",2873,18
"2874","Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the",2874,18
"2875","man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each",2875,18
"2876","was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.",2876,18
"2877","The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his",2877,19
"2878","declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as",2878,19
"2879","his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having",2879,19
"2880","no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the",2880,19
"2881","moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the",2881,19
"2882","observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding",2882,19
"2883","Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon",2883,19
"2884","after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,",2884,19

"2893","called out,",2893,19
"2894","""Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse",2894,19

"2902","consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it",2902,19
"2903","over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried",2903,19
"2904","to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided",2904,19
"2905","between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as",2905,19

"2907","""Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from",2907,19

"2909","would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little",2909,19
"2910","unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected",2910,19
"2911","mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport",2911,19
"2912","of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to",2912,19
"2913","dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as",2913,19

"2918","selecting a wife, as I certainly did.""",2918,19

"2928","of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.",2928,19

"2932","arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you",2932,19
"2933","must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a",2933,19
"2934","gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,",2934,19
"2935","useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small",2935,19
"2936","income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as",2936,19
"2937","you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the",2937,19
"2938","way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and",2938,19
"2939","kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the",2939,19
"2940","advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any",2940,19

"2942","acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect",2942,19
"2943","which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general",2943,19
"2944","intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views",2944,19
"2945","were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I",2945,19
"2946","assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that",2946,19
"2947","being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured",2947,19
"2948","father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy",2948,19

"2951","event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be",2951,19
"2952","for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I",2952,19
"2953","flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing",2953,19
"2954","remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the",2954,19
"2955","violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and",2955,19
"2956","shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well",2956,19
"2957","aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds",2957,19
"2958","in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's",2958,19
"2959","decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,",2959,19

"2972","third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just",2972,19

"2979","happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who",2979,19
"2980","would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I",2980,19

"2987","economy, and other amiable qualifications.""",2987,19
"2988","""Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must",2988,19

"2991","refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.",2991,19

"3278","her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before",3278,21
"3279","mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the",3279,21

"3282","frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her",3282,21
"3283","relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's",3283,21

"3290","finished it. ""Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare",3290,21
"3291","that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she",3291,21
"3292","is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she",3292,21
"3293","suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to",3293,21
"3294","put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?""",3294,21

"3296","""Most willingly.""",3296,21

"3300","does not care about you.""",3300,21
"3301","Jane shook her head.",3301,21
"3302","""Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you",3302,21
"3303","together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is",3303,21
"3304","not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy",3304,21
"3305","for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is",3305,21
"3306","this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the",3306,21
"3307","more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that",3307,21
"3308","when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in",3308,21
"3309","achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I",3309,21
"3310","dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,",3310,21
"3311","my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley",3311,21
"3312","tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest",3312,21
"3313","degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on",3313,21
"3314","Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of",3314,21
"3315","being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.""",3315,21
"3316","""If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"" replied Jane, ""your",3316,21
"3317","representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the",3317,21
"3318","foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any",3318,21
"3319","one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived",3319,21
"3320","herself.""",3320,21

"3327","""You must decide for yourself,"" said Elizabeth, ""and if upon mature",3327,21
"3328","deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is",3328,21

"3331","""How can you talk so?""--said Jane faintly smiling,--""You must know that",3331,21

"3339","contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's",3339,21
"3340","interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those",3340,21
"3341","wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man",3341,21
"3342","so totally independent of every one.",3342,21
"3343","She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on",3343,21
"3344","the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.",3344,21
"3345","Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,",3345,21
"3346","though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that",3346,21
"3347","Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.",3347,21
"3348","They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the",3348,21
"3349","family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;",3349,21
"3350","but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,",3350,21
"3351","and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen",3351,21
"3352","to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After",3352,21
"3353","lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking",3353,21
"3354","that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,",3354,21
"3355","and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though",3355,21
"3356","he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have",3356,21
"3357","two full courses.",3357,21
"3358","The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the",3358,22
"3359","chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.",3359,22
"3360","Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. ""It keeps him in good",3360,22
"3361","humour,"" said she, ""and I am more obliged to you than I can express.""",3361,22
"3362","Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and",3362,22
"3363","that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was",3363,22
"3364","very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth",3364,22
"3365","had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her",3365,22
"3366","from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards",3366,22
"3367","herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so",3367,22
"3368","favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost",3368,22
"3369","sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.",3369,22
"3370","But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his",3370,22
"3371","character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next",3371,22
"3372","morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw",3372,22
"3373","himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,",3373,22
"3374","from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to",3374,22
"3375","conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known",3375,22
"3376","till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost",3376,22
"3377","secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,",3377,22
"3378","he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His",3378,22
"3379","reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived",3379,22
"3380","him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly",3380,22
"3381","set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared",3381,22
"3382","to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.",3382,22
"3383","In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every",3383,22
"3384","thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they",3384,22
"3385","entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was",3385,22
"3386","to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be",3386,22
"3387","waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his",3387,22
"3388","happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must",3388,22
"3389","guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its",3389,22
"3390","continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and",3390,22
"3391","disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that",3391,22
"3392","establishment were gained.",3392,22
"3393","Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;",3393,22
"3394","and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present",3394,22
"3395","circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom",3395,22
"3396","they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were",3396,22
"3397","exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more",3397,22
"3398","interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer",3398,22
"3399","Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided",3399,22
"3400","opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the",3400,22
"3401","Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife",3401,22
"3402","should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family in short",3402,22
"3403","were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes",3403,22
"3404","of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have",3404,22
"3405","done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's",3405,22
"3406","dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had",3406,22
"3407","gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were",3407,22
"3408","in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor",3408,22
"3409","agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be",3409,22
"3410","imaginary. But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly",3410,22
"3411","either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it",3411,22
"3412","was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small",3412,22
"3413","fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their",3413,22
"3414","pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now",3414,22
"3415","obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been",3415,22
"3416","handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable",3416,22
"3417","circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to",3417,22
"3418","Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other",3418,22
"3419","person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though",3419,22
"3420","her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such",3420,22
"3421","disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and",3421,22
"3422","therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,",3422,22
"3423","to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise",3423,22
"3424","of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept",3424,22
"3425","without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst",3425,22
"3426","forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some",3426,22
"3427","ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great",3427,22
"3428","self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.",3428,22
"3429","As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the",3429,22
"3430","family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved",3430,22
"3431","for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said",3431,22
"3432","how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his",3432,22
"3433","other engagements might allow him to visit them.",3433,22
"3434","""My dear Madam,"" he replied, ""this invitation is particularly",3434,22
"3435","gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you",3435,22
"3436","may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as",3436,22
"3437","possible.""",3437,22
"3438","They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for",3438,22
"3439","so speedy a return, immediately said,",3439,22
"3440","""But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my",3440,22
"3441","good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of",3441,22
"3442","offending your patroness.""",3442,22
"3443","""My dear sir,"" replied Mr. Collins, ""I am particularly obliged to you",3443,22
"3444","for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so",3444,22
"3445","material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.""",3445,22
"3446","""You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her",3446,22
"3447","displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us",3447,22
"3448","again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,",3448,22
"3449","and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.""",3449,22
"3450","""Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such",3450,22
"3451","affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive",3451,22
"3452","from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of",3452,22
"3453","your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,",3453,22
"3454","though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall",3454,22
"3455","now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting",3455,22
"3456","my cousin Elizabeth.""",3456,22
"3457","With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally",3457,22
"3458","surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished",3458,22
"3459","to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of",3459,22
"3460","her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.",3460,22
"3461","She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a",3461,22
"3462","solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no",3462,22
"3463","means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and",3463,22
"3464","improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very",3464,22
"3465","agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this",3465,22
"3466","kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a",3466,22
"3467","private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.",3467,22
"3468","The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her",3468,22
"3469","friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but",3469,22
"3470","that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from",3470,22
"3471","possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her",3471,22
"3472","astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the",3472,22
"3473","bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,",3473,22
"3474","""Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!""",3474,22
"3475","The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her",3475,22
"3476","story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a",3476,22
"3477","reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon",3477,22
"3478","regained her composure, and calmly replied,",3478,22
"3479","""Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible",3479,22
"3480","that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,",3480,22
"3481","because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?""",3481,22
"3482","But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort",3482,22
"3483","for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect",3483,22
"3484","of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished",3484,22
"3485","her all imaginable happiness.",3485,22
"3486","""I see what you are feeling,"" replied Charlotte,--""you must be",3486,22
"3487","surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to",3487,22
"3488","marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you",3488,22
"3489","will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I",3489,22
"3490","never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's",3490,22
"3491","character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my",3491,22
"3492","chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on",3492,22
"3493","entering the marriage state.""",3493,22
"3494","Elizabeth quietly answered ""Undoubtedly;""--and after an awkward pause,",3494,22
"3495","they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much",3495,22
"3496","longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It",3496,22
"3497","was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so",3497,22
"3498","unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers",3498,22
"3499","of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being",3499,22
"3500","now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony",3500,22
"3501","was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it",3501,22
"3502","possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every",3502,22
"3503","better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,",3503,22
"3504","was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing",3504,22
"3505","herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction",3505,22
"3506","that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot",3506,22
"3507","she had chosen.",3507,22
"3508","Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what",3508,23
"3509","she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,",3509,23
"3510","when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to",3510,23
"3511","announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,",3511,23
"3512","and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the",3512,23
"3513","houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,",3513,23
"3514","but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than",3514,23
"3515","politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always",3515,23
"3516","unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,",3516,23
"3517","""Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know",3517,23
"3518","that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?""",3518,23
"3519","Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne",3519,23
"3520","without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried",3520,23
"3521","him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the",3521,23
"3522","truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the",3522,23
"3523","most forbearing courtesy.",3523,23
"3524","Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant",3524,23
"3525","a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by",3525,23
"3526","mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and",3526,23
"3527","endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,",3527,23
"3528","by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she",3528,23
"3529","was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the",3529,23
"3530","happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character",3530,23
"3531","of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.",3531,23
"3532","Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while",3532,23
"3533","Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings",3533,23
"3534","found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving",3534,23
"3535","the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins",3535,23
"3536","had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy",3536,23
"3537","together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two",3537,23
"3538","inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that",3538,23
"3539","Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that",3539,23

"3620","and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them",3620,23
"3621","from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by",3621,23

"3623","to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.",3623,23
"3624","Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any",3624,23

"3627","Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she",3627,23

"3630","whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that",3630,23
"3631","they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself",3631,23
"3632","and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She",3632,23
"3633","complained bitterly of all this to her husband.",3633,23

"3672","the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline",3672,24

"3685","of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave",3685,24

"3689","ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she",3689,24
"3690","thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on",3690,24

"3692","could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really",3692,24

"4078","for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the",4078,26

"4091","be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;",4091,26

"4096","altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly",4096,26
"4097","resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I",4097,26
"4098","cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as",4098,26
"4099","she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on",4099,26
"4100","her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been",4100,26
"4101","acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her",4101,26
"4102","brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and",4102,26
"4103","though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she",4103,26
"4104","feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so",4104,26
"4105","deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may",4105,26
"4106","feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,",4106,26
"4107","however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at",4107,26
"4108","all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my",4108,26
"4109","being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and",4109,26
"4110","yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to",4110,26
"4111","persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot",4111,26
"4112","understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should",4112,26
"4113","be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of",4113,26

"4135","herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,",4135,26

"4142","agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than",4142,26

"4170","as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing",4170,27
"4171","Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was",4171,27
"4172","novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such",4172,27
"4173","uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change",4173,27

"4213","shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.",4213,27
"4214","Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her",4214,27

"4217","spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to",4217,27
"4218","hope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the",4218,27

"4332","took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,",4332,28
"4333","probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's",4333,28
"4334","help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every",4334,28
"4335","thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of",4335,28
"4336","which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be",4336,28
"4337","forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by",4337,28
"4338","Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often",4338,28
"4339","forgotten.",4339,28
"4340","She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It",4340,28
"4341","was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining",4341,28

"4346","doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when",4346,28

"4358","telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,",4358,28
"4359","Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon",4359,28
"4360","Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,",4360,28
"4361","and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it",4361,28
"4362","was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would",4362,28
"4363","pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious",4363,28
"4364","interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with",4364,28
"4365","Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.",4365,28
"4366","About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready",4366,28
"4367","for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in",4367,28
"4368","confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up",4368,28
"4369","stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the",4369,28
"4370","door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with",4370,28

"4378","garden gate.",4378,28
"4379","""And is this all?"" cried Elizabeth. ""I expected at least that the pigs",4379,28

"4396","greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh",4396,28
"4397","looked that way.",4397,28
"4398","At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and",4398,28
"4399","the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two",4399,28
"4400","girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which",4400,28
"4401","Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked",4401,28
"4402","to dine at Rosings the next day.",4402,28

"4415","your arrival!""",4415,29

"4417","""from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which",4417,29

"4429","for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for",4429,29

"4434","objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of",4434,29
"4435","her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,",4435,29

"4443","slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the",4443,29
"4444","house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally",4444,29
"4445","cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.",4445,29
"4446","When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every",4446,29
"4447","moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly",4447,29
"4448","calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of",4448,29
"4449","Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or",4449,29
"4450","miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she",4450,29
"4451","thought she could witness without trepidation.",4451,29
"4452","From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a",4452,29

"4454","the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,",4454,29
"4455","her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great",4455,29
"4456","condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it",4456,29
"4457","with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was",4457,29
"4458","performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks",4458,29
"4459","which he would have thought necessary.",4459,29
"4460","In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely",4460,29
"4461","awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage",4461,29
"4462","enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;",4462,29
"4463","and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge",4463,29
"4464","of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself",4464,29
"4465","quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her",4465,29
"4466","composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with",4466,29
"4467","strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air",4467,29
"4468","was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to",4468,29
"4469","make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered",4469,29
"4470","formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so",4470,29
"4471","authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.",4471,29
"4472","Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the",4472,29
"4473","day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had",4473,29
"4474","represented.",4474,29
"4475","When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment",4475,29
"4476","she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the",4476,29
"4477","daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her",4477,29
"4478","being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any",4478,29
"4479","likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her",4479,29
"4480","features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very",4480,29
"4481","little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance",4481,29
"4482","there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening",4482,29
"4483","to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before",4483,29
"4484","her eyes.",4484,29
"4485","After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,",4485,29
"4486","to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its",4486,29
"4487","beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much",4487,29
"4488","better worth looking at in the summer.",4488,29
"4489","The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,",4489,29
"4490","and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he",4490,29
"4491","had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by",4491,29
"4492","her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish",4492,29
"4493","nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted",4493,29
"4494","alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir",4494,29
"4495","William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law",4495,29
"4496","said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.",4496,29
"4497","But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and",4497,29
"4498","gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved",4498,29
"4499","a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth",4499,29
"4500","was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated",4500,29
"4501","between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in",4501,29
"4502","listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all",4502,29
"4503","dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little",4503,29
"4504","Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she",4504,29
"4505","were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the",4505,29
"4506","gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.",4506,29
"4507","When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be",4507,29
"4508","done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any",4508,29
"4509","intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every",4509,29
"4510","subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have",4510,29
"4511","her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte's domestic",4511,29
"4512","concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,",4512,29
"4513","as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be",4513,29
"4514","regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the",4514,29
"4515","care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was",4515,29
"4516","beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an",4516,29
"4517","occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with",4517,29
"4518","Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and",4518,29
"4519","Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew",4519,29
"4520","the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,",4520,29
"4521","pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters",4521,29
"4522","she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of",4522,29
"4523","them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they",4523,29
"4524","had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her",4524,29
"4525","mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her",4525,29
"4526","questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then",4526,29
"4527","observed,",4527,29
"4528","""Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your",4528,29

"4600","uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson",4600,29
"4601","expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or",4601,29
"4602","having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the",4602,29
"4603","other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes",4603,29
"4604","of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins",4604,29
"4605","was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her",4605,29
"4606","for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.",4606,29
"4607","Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes",4607,29
"4608","and noble names.",4608,29
"4609","When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,",4609,29
"4610","the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,",4610,29
"4611","gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered",4611,29
"4612","round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were",4612,29
"4613","to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the",4613,29
"4614","arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.",4614,29
"4615","Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. As",4615,29
"4616","soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her",4616,29
"4617","cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,",4617,29
"4618","for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But",4618,29
"4619","her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means",4619,29
"4620","satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's",4620,29
"4621","praise into his own hands.",4621,29
"4622","Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough",4622,30
"4623","to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of",4623,30
"4624","her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met",4624,30
"4625","with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings",4625,30
"4626","to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he",4626,30
"4627","went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and",4627,30
"4628","Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin",4628,30
"4629","by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and",4629,30
"4630","dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading",4630,30
"4631","and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which",4631,30
"4632","fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.",4632,30
"4633","Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer",4633,30
"4634","the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a",4634,30
"4635","pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent",4635,30
"4636","reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been",4636,30
"4637","much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and",4637,30
"4638","she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.",4638,30
"4639","From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and",4639,30
"4640","were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went",4640,30
"4641","along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,",4641,30
"4642","which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened",4642,30
"4643","almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had",4643,30
"4644","a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever",4644,30
"4645","prevailed on to get out.",4645,30
"4646","Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and",4646,30
"4647","not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;",4647,30
"4648","and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings",4648,30
"4649","to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many",4649,30
"4650","hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,",4650,30
"4651","and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during",4651,30
"4652","these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,",4652,30
"4653","and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement",4653,30
"4654","of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she",4654,30
"4655","accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding",4655,30
"4656","out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.",4656,30
"4657","Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the",4657,30
"4658","commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate",4658,30
"4659","in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by",4659,30
"4660","Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be",4660,30
"4661","quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the",4661,30
"4662","village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold",4662,30
"4663","them into harmony and plenty.",4663,30
"4664","The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;",4664,30
"4665","and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card",4665,30
"4666","table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of",4666,30
"4667","the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of",4667,30
"4668","the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach. This",4668,30
"4669","however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time",4669,30
"4670","comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with",4670,30
"4671","Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she",4671,30
"4672","had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where",4672,30
"4673","she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was",4673,30
"4674","along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was",4674,30
"4675","a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and",4675,30
"4676","where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.",4676,30
"4677","In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.",4677,30
"4678","Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an",4678,30
"4679","addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be",4679,30
"4680","important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy",4680,30
"4681","was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were",4681,30
"4682","not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would",4682,30
"4683","furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and",4683,30
"4684","she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him",4684,30
"4685","were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined",4685,30
"4686","by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest",4686,30
"4687","satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and",4687,30
"4688","seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by",4688,30
"4689","Miss Lucas and herself.",4689,30
"4690","His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking",4690,30
"4691","the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,",4691,30
"4692","in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow",4692,30
"4693","as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great",4693,30
"4694","intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his",4694,30
"4695","respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for",4695,30
"4696","Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of",4696,30
"4697","his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when",4697,30
"4698","Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen",4698,30
"4699","them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running",4699,30
"4700","into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,",4700,30
"4701","""I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would",4701,30
"4702","never have come so soon to wait upon me.""",4702,30
"4703","Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,",4703,30
"4704","before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly",4704,30
"4705","afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,",4705,30
"4706","who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and",4706,30
"4707","address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been",4707,30
"4708","used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual",4708,30
"4709","reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her",4709,30
"4710","friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely",4710,30
"4711","curtseyed to him, without saying a word.",4711,30
"4712","Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the",4712,30
"4713","readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but",4713,30
"4714","his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and",4714,30
"4715","garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.",4715,30
"4716","At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of",4716,30
"4717","Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual",4717,30
"4718","way, and after a moment's pause, added,",4718,30
"4719","""My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never",4719,30
"4720","happened to see her there?""",4720,30
"4721","She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see",4721,30
"4722","whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the",4722,30
"4723","Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he",4723,30
"4724","answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The",4724,30
"4725","subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went",4725,30
"4726","away.",4726,30
"4727","Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,",4727,31
"4728","and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of",4728,31
"4729","their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they",4729,31
"4730","received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the",4730,31
"4731","house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,",4731,31
"4732","almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by",4732,31
"4733","such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to",4733,31
"4734","come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little",4734,31
"4735","of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called",4735,31
"4736","at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had",4736,31
"4737","only seen at church.",4737,31
"4738","The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined",4738,31
"4739","the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them",4739,31
"4740","civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so",4740,31
"4741","acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,",4741,31
"4742","almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,",4742,31
"4743","much more than to any other person in the room.",4743,31
"4744","Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a",4744,31
"4745","welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had",4745,31
"4746","moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and",4746,31
"4747","talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying",4747,31
"4748","at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so",4748,31
"4749","well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much",4749,31
"4750","spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as",4750,31
"4751","well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned",4751,31
"4752","towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a",4752,31
"4753","while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not",4753,31
"4754","scruple to call out,",4754,31
"4755","""What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking",4755,31
"4756","of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.""",4756,31
"4757","""We are speaking of music, Madam,"" said he, when no longer able to avoid",4757,31
"4758","a reply.",4758,31
"4759","""Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I",4759,31
"4760","must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.",4760,31
"4761","There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment",4761,31
"4762","of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I",4762,31
"4763","should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health",4763,31
"4764","had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed",4764,31
"4765","delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?""",4765,31
"4766","Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.",4766,31

"4769","if she does not practise a great deal.""",4769,31
"4770","""I assure you, Madam,"" he replied, ""that she does not need such advice.",4770,31
"4771","She practises very constantly.""",4771,31
"4772","""So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write",4772,31
"4773","to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often",4773,31
"4774","tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,",4774,31
"4775","without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that",4775,31
"4776","she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though",4776,31
"4777","Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often",4777,31
"4778","told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in",4778,31

"4780","part of the house.""",4780,31
"4781","Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made",4781,31
"4782","no answer.",4782,31
"4783","When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having",4783,31
"4784","promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He",4784,31
"4785","drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then",4785,31
"4786","talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from",4786,31
"4787","her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,",4787,31
"4788","stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's",4788,31
"4789","countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first",4789,31
"4790","convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,",4790,31
"4791","""You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear",4791,31

"4798","have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you",4798,31
"4799","find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact",4799,31

"4805","part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree",4805,31

"4946","and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised",4946,32
"4947","them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding",4947,32
"4948","on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying",4948,32
"4949","much to any body, went away.",4949,32
"4950","""What can be the meaning of this!"" said Charlotte, as soon as he was",4950,32

"4955","conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from",4955,32
"4956","the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable",4956,32
"4957","from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there",4957,32
"4958","was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be",4958,32
"4959","always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the",4959,32
"4960","pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the",4960,32
"4961","two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither",4961,32
"4962","almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes",4962,32
"4963","separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their",4963,32
"4964","aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he",4964,32
"4965","had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended",4965,32
"4966","him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in",4966,32
"4967","being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her",4967,32
"4968","former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw",4968,32
"4969","there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,",4969,32
"4970","she believed he might have the best informed mind.",4970,32
"4971","But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult",4971,32
"4972","to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there",4972,32
"4973","ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it",4973,32
"4974","seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to",4974,32
"4975","propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really",4975,32
"4976","animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel",4976,32
"4977","Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was",4977,32
"4978","generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told",4978,32
"4979","her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of",4979,32
"4980","love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself",4980,32
"4981","seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at",4981,32
"4982","Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He",4982,32
"4983","certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that",4983,32
"4984","look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often",4984,32
"4985","doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it",4985,32
"4986","seemed nothing but absence of mind.",4986,32
"4987","She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his",4987,32
"4988","being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.",4988,32
"4989","Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of",4989,32
"4990","raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her",4990,32
"4991","opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would",4991,32
"4992","vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.",4992,32
"4993","In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying",4993,32
"4994","Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he",4994,32
"4995","certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,",4995,32
"4996","to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage",4996,32
"4997","in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.",4997,32
"4998","More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly",4998,33
"4999","meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that",4999,33
"5000","should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever",5000,33
"5001","happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a",5001,33
"5002","favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was",5002,33
"5003","very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful",5003,33
"5004","ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not",5004,33
"5005","merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he",5005,33
"5006","actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never",5006,33
"5007","said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of",5007,33
"5008","listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre",5008,33
"5009","that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in",5009,33
"5010","being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.",5010,33
"5011","and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her",5011,33
"5012","not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever",5012,33
"5013","she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words",5013,33
"5014","seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?",5014,33
"5015","She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what",5015,33
"5016","might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was",5016,33
"5017","quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the",5017,33
"5018","Parsonage.",5018,33
"5019","She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last",5019,33
"5020","letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not",5020,33
"5021","written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,",5021,33
"5022","she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting",5022,33
"5023","away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,",5023,33
"5024","""I did not know before that you ever walked this way.""",5024,33
"5025","""I have been making the tour of the Park,"" he replied, ""as I generally",5025,33
"5026","do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are",5026,33
"5027","you going much farther?""",5027,33
"5028","""No, I should have turned in a moment.""",5028,33
"5029","And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage",5029,33
"5030","together.",5030,33
"5031","""Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"" said she.",5031,33
"5032","""Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He",5032,33
"5033","arranges the business just as he pleases.""",5033,33
"5034","""And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least",5034,33
"5035","great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems",5035,33
"5036","more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.""",5036,33
"5037","""He likes to have his own way very well,"" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.",5037,33
"5038","""But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than",5038,33
"5039","many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak",5039,33
"5040","feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and",5040,33
"5041","dependence.""",5041,33
"5042","""In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of",5042,33
"5043","either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and",5043,33
"5044","dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going",5044,33
"5045","wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?""",5045,33
"5046","""These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have",5046,33
"5047","experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater",5047,33
"5048","weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry",5048,33
"5049","where they like.""",5049,33
"5050","""Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often",5050,33

"5054","money.""",5054,33
"5055","""Is this,"" thought Elizabeth, ""meant for me?"" and she coloured at the",5055,33

"5057","the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is",5057,33
"5058","very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.""",5058,33
"5059","He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt",5059,33
"5060","a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,",5060,33
"5061","she soon afterwards said,",5061,33
"5062","""I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of",5062,33

"5077","""You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare",5077,33

"5129","could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have",5129,33
"5130","such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures",5130,33
"5131","taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she",5131,33
"5132","had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and",5132,33
"5133","arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,",5133,33
"5134","_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that",5134,33
"5135","Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a",5135,33
"5136","while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart",5136,33
"5137","in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have",5137,33
"5138","inflicted.",5138,33
"5139","""There were some very strong objections against the lady,"" were Colonel",5139,33
"5140","Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her",5140,33
"5141","having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in",5141,33
"5142","business in London.",5142,33
"5143","""To Jane herself,"" she exclaimed, ""there could be no possibility of",5143,33
"5144","objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding",5144,33
"5145","excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could",5145,33
"5146","any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some",5146,33
"5147","peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,",5147,33
"5148","and respectability which he will probably never reach."" When she thought",5148,33
"5149","of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would",5149,33
"5150","not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.",5150,33
"5151","Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from",5151,33
"5152","the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want",5152,33
"5153","of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly",5153,33
"5154","governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of",5154,33
"5155","retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.",5155,33
"5156","The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a",5156,33
"5157","headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to",5157,33
"5158","her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her",5158,33
"5159","cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,",5159,33
"5160","seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much",5160,33
"5161","as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins",5161,33
"5162","could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather",5162,33
"5163","displeased by her staying at home.",5163,33
"5164","When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as",5164,34
"5165","much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the",5165,34
"5166","examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her",5166,34
"5167","being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any",5167,34
"5168","revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.",5168,34
"5169","But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that",5169,34
"5170","cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,",5170,34
"5171","proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly",5171,34
"5172","disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth",5172,34
"5173","noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an",5173,34
"5174","attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's",5174,34
"5175","shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a",5175,34
"5176","keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to",5176,34
"5177","think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,",5177,34
"5178","and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be",5178,34
"5179","with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her",5179,34
"5180","spirits, by all that affection could do.",5180,34
"5181","She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that",5181,34
"5182","his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear",5182,34
"5183","that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not",5183,34
"5184","mean to be unhappy about him.",5184,34
"5185","While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the",5185,34
"5186","door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its",5186,34
"5187","being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in",5187,34
"5188","the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But",5188,34
"5189","this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently",5189,34
"5190","affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the",5190,34
"5191","room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her",5191,34
"5192","health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.",5192,34
"5193","She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and",5193,34
"5194","then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said",5194,34
"5195","not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an",5195,34
"5196","agitated manner, and thus began,",5196,34
"5197","""In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be",5197,34
"5198","repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love",5198,34
"5199","you.""",5199,34
"5200","Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,",5200,34
"5201","doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,",5201,34
"5202","and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,",5202,34
"5203","immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides",5203,34
"5204","those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the",5204,34
"5205","subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of",5205,34
"5206","its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had",5206,34
"5207","always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed",5207,34
"5208","due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to",5208,34
"5209","recommend his suit.",5209,34
"5210","In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to",5210,34
"5211","the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did",5211,34
"5212","not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to",5212,34
"5213","receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost",5213,34
"5214","all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to",5214,34
"5215","answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with",5215,34
"5216","representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of",5216,34
"5217","all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with",5217,34
"5218","expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of",5218,34
"5219","his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of",5219,34
"5220","a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his",5220,34
"5221","countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only",5221,34
"5222","exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her",5222,34
"5223","cheeks, and she said,",5223,34
"5224","""In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to",5224,34
"5225","express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however",5225,34
"5226","unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be",5226,34

"5228","cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly",5228,34

"5231","short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the",5231,34
"5232","acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming",5232,34
"5233","it after this explanation.""",5233,34
"5234","Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed",5234,34
"5235","on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than",5235,34
"5236","surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of",5236,34
"5237","his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the",5237,34
"5238","appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed",5238,34
"5239","himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings",5239,34
"5240","dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,",5240,34
"5241","""And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I",5241,34
"5242","might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at",5242,34

"5252","happiness of a most beloved sister?""",5252,34
"5253","As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion",5253,34

"5355","sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,",5355,35

"5362","made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the",5362,35
"5363","verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,",5363,35
"5364","when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which",5364,35
"5365","edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.",5365,35
"5366","Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now",5366,35
"5367","near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced",5367,35

"5380","full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated",5380,35

"5394","magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned",5394,35
"5395","was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached",5395,35
"5396","Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in",5396,35
"5397","defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,",5397,35
"5398","ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.",5398,35
"5399","Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of",5399,35
"5400","my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who",5400,35
"5401","had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who",5401,35
"5402","had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,",5402,35
"5403","to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could",5403,35
"5404","be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But",5404,35
"5405","from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally",5405,35
"5406","bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in",5406,35
"5407","future secured, when the following account of my actions and their",5407,35
"5408","motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is",5408,35
"5409","due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which",5409,35
"5410","may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The",5410,35
"5411","necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I",5411,35
"5412","had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with",5412,35
"5413","others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other",5413,35
"5414","young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the",5414,35
"5415","dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a",5415,35
"5416","serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that",5416,35
"5417","ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made",5417,35
"5418","acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that",5418,35
"5419","Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general",5419,35
"5420","expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,",5420,35
"5421","of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I",5421,35
"5422","observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then",5422,35
"5423","perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had",5423,35
"5424","ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and",5424,35
"5425","manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any",5425,35
"5426","symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the",5426,35
"5427","evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with",5427,35
"5428","pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of",5428,35
"5429","sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have",5429,35
"5430","been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make",5430,35
"5431","the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such",5431,35
"5432","error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been",5432,35
"5433","unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity",5433,35
"5434","of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given",5434,35
"5435","the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her",5435,35
"5436","temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was",5436,35
"5437","desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will",5437,35
"5438","venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually",5438,35
"5439","influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be",5439,35
"5440","indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial",5440,35
"5441","conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to",5441,35
"5442","the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged",5442,35
"5443","to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my",5443,35
"5444","own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to",5444,35
"5445","my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of",5445,35
"5446","repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to",5446,35
"5447","an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to",5447,35
"5448","forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes",5448,35
"5449","must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's",5449,35
"5450","family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that",5450,35
"5451","total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed",5451,35
"5452","by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by",5452,35
"5453","your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst",5453,35
"5454","your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your",5454,35
"5455","displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you",5455,35
"5456","consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to",5456,35
"5457","avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally",5457,35
"5458","bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to",5458,35
"5459","the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that",5459,35
"5460","from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was",5460,35
"5461","confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me",5461,35
"5462","before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy",5462,35
"5463","connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,",5463,35
"5464","as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon",5464,35
"5465","returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His",5465,35
"5466","sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our",5466,35
"5467","coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible",5467,35
"5468","that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly",5468,35
"5469","resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly",5469,35
"5470","went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to",5470,35
"5471","my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and",5471,35
"5472","enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have",5472,35
"5473","staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it",5473,35
"5474","would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been",5474,35
"5475","seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your",5475,35
"5476","sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his",5476,35
"5477","affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has",5477,35
"5478","great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment",5478,35
"5479","than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived",5479,35
"5480","himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against",5480,35
"5481","returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,",5481,35
"5482","was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for",5482,35
"5483","having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the",5483,35
"5484","whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is",5484,35
"5485","that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to",5485,35
"5486","conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as",5486,35
"5487","it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant",5487,35
"5488","of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is",5488,35
"5489","perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough",5489,35
"5490","extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this",5490,35
"5491","concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,",5491,35
"5492","and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more",5492,35
"5493","to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's",5493,35
"5494","feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which",5494,35
"5495","governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have",5495,35
"5496","not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more",5496,35
"5497","weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only",5497,35
"5498","refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my",5498,35
"5499","family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but",5499,35
"5500","of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one",5500,35
"5501","witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very",5501,35
"5502","respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the",5502,35
"5503","Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his",5503,35
"5504","trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on",5504,35
"5505","George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore",5505,35
"5506","liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and",5506,35
"5507","afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own",5507,35
"5508","father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have",5508,35
"5509","been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not",5509,35
"5510","only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always",5510,35
"5511","engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the",5511,35
"5512","church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.",5512,35
"5513","As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think",5513,35
"5514","of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the",5514,35
"5515","want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge",5515,35
"5516","of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man",5516,35
"5517","of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of",5517,35
"5518","seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.",5518,35
"5519","Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.",5519,35
"5520","But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a",5520,35
"5521","suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his",5521,35
"5522","real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father",5522,35
"5523","died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to",5523,35
"5524","the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it",5524,35
"5525","to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his",5525,35
"5526","profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a",5526,35
"5527","valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became",5527,35
"5528","vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own",5528,35
"5529","father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these",5529,35
"5530","events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally",5530,35
"5531","resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it",5531,35
"5532","unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary",5532,35
"5533","advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be",5533,35
"5534","benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,",5534,35
"5535","and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would",5535,35
"5536","be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than",5536,35
"5537","believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to",5537,35
"5538","accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a",5538,35
"5539","clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all",5539,35
"5540","claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could",5540,35
"5541","ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three",5541,35
"5542","thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I",5542,35
"5543","thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his",5543,35
"5544","society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his",5544,35
"5545","studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all",5545,35
"5546","restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For",5546,35
"5547","about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the",5547,35
"5548","incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied",5548,35
"5549","to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he",5549,35
"5550","assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were",5550,35
"5551","exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,",5551,35
"5552","and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would",5552,35
"5553","present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there",5553,35
"5554","could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other",5554,35
"5555","person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered",5555,35
"5556","father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to",5556,35
"5557","comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.",5557,35
"5558","His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his",5558,35
"5559","circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me",5559,35
"5560","to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every",5560,35
"5561","appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But",5561,35
"5562","last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I",5562,35
"5563","must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget",5563,35
"5564","myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce",5564,35
"5565","me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no",5565,35
"5566","doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my",5566,35
"5567","junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel",5567,35
"5568","Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from",5568,35
"5569","school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last",5569,35
"5570","summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;",5570,35
"5571","and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there",5571,35
"5572","proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.",5572,35
"5573","Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by",5573,35
"5574","her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,",5574,35
"5575","whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his",5575,35
"5576","kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe",5576,35
"5577","herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but",5577,35
"5578","fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her",5578,35
"5579","imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to",5579,35
"5580","herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the",5580,35
"5581","intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea",5581,35
"5582","of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as",5582,35
"5583","a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt",5583,35
"5584","and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings",5584,35
"5585","prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left",5585,35
"5586","the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from",5586,35
"5587","her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my",5587,35
"5588","sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot",5588,35
"5589","help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a",5589,35
"5590","strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.",5590,35
"5591","This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we",5591,35
"5592","have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject",5592,35
"5593","it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty",5593,35
"5594","towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of",5594,35
"5595","falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to",5595,35
"5596","be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing",5596,35
"5597","concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and",5597,35
"5598","suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly",5598,35
"5599","wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then",5599,35
"5600","master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.",5600,35
"5601","For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more",5601,35
"5602","particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our",5602,35
"5603","near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of",5603,35
"5604","the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted",5604,35
"5605","with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of",5605,35
"5606","_me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented",5606,35
"5607","by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may",5607,35
"5608","be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find",5608,35
"5609","some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course",5609,35
"5610","of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.",5610,35
"5611","""FITZWILLIAM DARCY.""",5611,35
"5612","If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to",5612,36
"5613","contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of",5613,36
"5614","its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly",5614,36
"5615","she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.",5615,36
"5616","Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did",5616,36
"5617","she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;",5617,36
"5618","and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to",5618,36
"5619","give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong",5619,36
"5620","prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of",5620,36
"5621","what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which",5621,36
"5622","hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing",5622,36
"5623","what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the",5623,36
"5624","sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's",5624,36
"5625","insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of",5625,36
"5626","the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have",5626,36
"5627","any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had",5627,36
"5628","done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It",5628,36
"5629","was all pride and insolence.",5629,36
"5630","But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when",5630,36
"5631","she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,",5631,36
"5632","if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which",5632,36
"5633","bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings",5633,36
"5634","were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.",5634,36
"5635","Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished",5635,36
"5636","to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, ""This must be false!",5636,36
"5637","This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!""--and when she had",5637,36
"5638","gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the",5638,36
"5639","last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not",5639,36
"5640","regard it, that she would never look in it again.",5640,36
"5641","In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on",5641,36
"5642","nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter",5642,36
"5643","was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she",5643,36
"5644","again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and",5644,36
"5645","commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.",5645,36
"5646","The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly",5646,36
"5647","what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,",5647,36
"5648","though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his",5648,36
"5649","own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to",5649,36
"5650","the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living",5650,36
"5651","was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was",5651,36
"5652","impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the",5652,36
"5653","other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did",5653,36
"5654","not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the",5654,36
"5655","particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions",5655,36
"5656","to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three",5656,36
"5657","thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the",5657,36
"5658","letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be",5658,36
"5659","impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with",5659,36
"5660","little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.",5660,36
"5661","But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had",5661,36
"5662","believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to",5662,36
"5663","render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a",5663,36
"5664","turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.",5664,36
"5665","The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to",5665,36
"5666","Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could",5666,36
"5667","bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his",5667,36
"5668","entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the",5668,36
"5669","persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,",5669,36
"5670","had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,",5670,36
"5671","nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to",5671,36
"5672","his real character, had information been in her power, she had never",5672,36
"5673","felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had",5673,36
"5674","established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to",5674,36
"5675","recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of",5675,36
"5676","integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.",5676,36
"5677","Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those",5677,36
"5678","casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy",5678,36
"5679","had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no",5679,36
"5680","such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before",5680,36
"5681","her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more",5681,36
"5682","substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and",5682,36
"5683","the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After",5683,36
"5684","pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to",5684,36
"5685","read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,",5685,36
"5686","received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel",5686,36
"5687","Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was",5687,36
"5688","referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam",5688,36
"5689","himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his",5689,36
"5690","near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no",5690,36
"5691","reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to",5691,36
"5692","him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and",5692,36
"5693","at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never",5693,36
"5694","have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his",5694,36
"5695","cousin's corroboration.",5695,36
"5696","She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation",5696,36
"5697","between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.",5697,36
"5698","Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_",5698,36
"5699","struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and",5699,36
"5700","wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting",5700,36
"5701","himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions",5701,36
"5702","with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear",5702,36
"5703","of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that",5703,36
"5704","_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball",5704,36
"5705","the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield",5705,36
"5706","family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but",5706,36
"5707","herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where",5707,36
"5708","discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.",5708,36
"5709","Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the",5709,36
"5710","father, would always prevent his exposing the son.",5710,36
"5711","How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!",5711,36
"5712","His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and",5712,36
"5713","hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer",5713,36
"5714","the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.",5714,36
"5715","His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had",5715,36
"5716","either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying",5716,36
"5717","his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most",5717,36
"5718","incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter",5718,36
"5719","and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not",5719,36
"5720","but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago",5720,36
"5721","asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as",5721,36
"5722","were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their",5722,36
"5723","acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much",5723,36
"5724","together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing",5724,36
"5725","that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him",5725,36
"5726","of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was",5726,36
"5727","esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a",5727,36
"5728","brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of",5728,36
"5729","his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling. That had",5729,36
"5730","his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of",5730,36
"5731","every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and",5731,36
"5732","that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man",5732,36
"5733","as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.",5733,36
"5734","She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham",5734,36
"5735","could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,",5735,36
"5736","prejudiced, absurd.",5736,36
"5737","""How despicably have I acted!"" she cried.--""I, who have prided myself on",5737,36
"5738","my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have",5738,36
"5739","often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my",5739,36
"5740","vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this",5740,36
"5741","discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could",5741,36
"5742","not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my",5742,36
"5743","folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect",5743,36
"5744","of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted",5744,36
"5745","prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were",5745,36
"5746","concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.""",5746,36
"5747","From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line",5747,36
"5748","which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation",5748,36
"5749","_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely",5749,36
"5750","different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that",5750,36
"5751","credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to",5751,36
"5752","give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally",5752,36
"5753","unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help",5753,36
"5754","remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she",5754,36
"5755","deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's",5755,36
"5756","feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a",5756,36
"5757","constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great",5757,36
"5758","sensibility.",5758,36
"5759","When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were",5759,36
"5760","mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense",5760,36
"5761","of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly",5761,36
"5762","for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as",5762,36
"5763","having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first",5763,36
"5764","disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind",5764,36
"5765","than on hers.",5765,36
"5766","The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed,",5766,36
"5767","but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus",5767,36
"5768","self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that",5768,36
"5769","Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest",5769,36
"5770","relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt",5770,36
"5771","by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she",5771,36
"5772","had ever known before.",5772,36
"5773","After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every",5773,36
"5774","variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,",5774,36
"5775","and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and",5775,36
"5776","so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her",5776,36
"5777","at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of",5777,36
"5778","appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such",5778,36
"5779","reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.",5779,36
"5780","She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each",5780,36
"5781","called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take",5781,36
"5782","leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least",5782,36
"5783","an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her",5783,36
"5784","till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in",5784,36
"5785","missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no",5785,36

"5788","been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was",5788,37
"5789","able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very",5789,37
"5790","good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the",5790,37
"5791","melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then",5791,37
"5792","hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,",5792,37
"5793","brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,",5793,37
"5794","importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of",5794,37
"5795","having them all to dine with her.",5795,37
"5796","Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had",5796,37
"5797","she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her",5797,37
"5798","future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her",5798,37
"5799","ladyship's indignation would have been. ""What would she have said?--how",5799,37
"5800","would she have behaved?"" were questions with which she amused herself.",5800,37
"5801","Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--""I assure",5801,37

"5804","attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to",5804,37

"5863","she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly",5863,37

"5885","Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good",5885,37

"6448","something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive",6448,41
"6449","and anxious attention, while she added,",6449,41
"6450","""When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that",6450,41
"6451","either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from",6451,41
"6452","knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.""",6452,41
"6453","Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated",6453,41
"6454","look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his",6454,41
"6455","embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of",6455,41
"6456","accents,",6456,41
"6457","""You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily",6457,41
"6458","comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume",6458,41
"6459","even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,",6459,41
"6460","may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter",6460,41
"6461","him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that",6461,41
"6462","the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,",6462,41
"6463","is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and",6463,41
"6464","judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her, has always operated, I",6464,41
"6465","know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his",6465,41
"6466","wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he",6466,41
"6467","has very much at heart.""",6467,41
"6468","Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a",6468,41
"6469","slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on",6469,41
"6470","the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge",6470,41
"6471","him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,",6471,41
"6472","of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish",6472,41
"6473","Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a",6473,41
"6474","mutual desire of never meeting again.",6474,41
"6475","When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,",6475,41
"6476","from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation",6476,41
"6477","between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the",6477,41
"6478","only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.",6478,41
"6479","Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,",6479,41
"6480","and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the",6480,41
"6481","opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there",6481,41
"6482","was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous",6482,41

"6484","of her sisters were uttered without being heard.",6484,41
"6485","Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could",6485,42
"6486","not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic",6486,42
"6487","comfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance",6487,42
"6488","of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a",6488,42
"6489","woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in",6489,42
"6490","their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,",6490,42
"6491","esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of",6491,42
"6492","domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a",6492,42
"6493","disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own",6493,42
"6494","imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often",6494,42
"6495","console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of",6495,42
"6496","the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal",6496,42
"6497","enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as",6497,42
"6498","her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not",6498,42
"6499","the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his",6499,42
"6500","wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true",6500,42
"6501","philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.",6501,42
"6502","Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her",6502,42
"6503","father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but",6503,42
"6504","respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of",6504,42
"6505","herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to",6505,42
"6506","banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation",6506,42
"6507","and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own",6507,42
"6508","children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so",6508,42
"6509","strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so",6509,42
"6510","unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils",6510,42
"6511","arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly",6511,42
"6512","used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,",6512,42
"6513","even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.",6513,42
"6514","When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little",6514,42
"6515","other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties",6515,42
"6516","abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and",6516,42
"6517","sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around",6517,42
"6518","them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty",6518,42
"6519","might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers",6519,42
"6520","of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition",6520,42
"6521","greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her",6521,42
"6522","folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering",6522,42
"6523","place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been",6523,42
"6524","sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward",6524,42
"6525","with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the",6525,42
"6526","satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to",6526,42
"6527","name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have",6527,42
"6528","some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by",6528,42
"6529","again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the",6529,42
"6530","present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes",6530,42
"6531","was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation",6531,42
"6532","for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her",6532,42
"6533","mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in",6533,42

"6536","Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.",6536,42
"6537","But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my",6537,42
"6538","sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of",6538,42
"6539","pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can",6539,42
"6540","never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by",6540,42
"6541","the defence of some little peculiar vexation.""",6541,42
"6542","When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely",6542,42
"6543","to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and",6543,42
"6544","always very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that",6544,42
"6545","they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers",6545,42
"6546","had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as",6546,42
"6547","made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which",6547,42
"6548","she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a",6548,42
"6549","violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the",6549,42
"6550","camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less",6550,42
"6551","to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much",6551,42
"6552","too full of lines under the words to be made public.",6552,42
"6553","After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good",6553,42
"6554","humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn. Everything wore",6554,42
"6555","a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came",6555,42
"6556","back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet",6556,42
"6557","was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June",6557,42
"6558","Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without",6558,42
"6559","tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by",6559,42
"6560","the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to",6560,42
"6561","mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious",6561,42
"6562","arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in",6562,42
"6563","Meryton.",6563,42
"6564","The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast",6564,42
"6565","approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter",6565,42
"6566","arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and",6566,42
"6567","curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from",6567,42
"6568","setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again",6568,42
"6569","within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so",6569,42
"6570","far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with",6570,42
"6571","the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up",6571,42
"6572","the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the",6572,42
"6573","present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that",6573,42
"6574","county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three",6574,42
"6575","weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The",6575,42
"6576","town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where",6576,42
"6577","they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of",6577,42
"6578","her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,",6578,42
"6579","Dovedale, or the Peak.",6579,42
"6580","Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing",6580,42
"6581","the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it",6581,42
"6582","was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;",6582,42
"6583","and all was soon right again.",6583,42
"6584","With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was",6584,42
"6585","impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its",6585,42
"6586","owner. ""But surely,"" said she, ""I may enter his county with impunity,",6586,42
"6587","and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.""",6587,42
"6588","The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away",6588,42
"6589","before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and",6589,42
"6590","Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at",6590,42
"6591","Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two",6591,42
"6592","younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin",6592,42
"6593","Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and",6593,42
"6594","sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every",6594,42
"6595","way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.",6595,42
"6596","The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next",6596,42
"6597","morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One",6597,42
"6598","enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a",6598,42
"6599","suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear",6599,42
"6600","inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection",6600,42
"6601","and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were",6601,42
"6602","disappointments abroad.",6602,42
"6603","It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,",6603,42

"6605","lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c. are",6605,42
"6606","sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present",6606,42
"6607","concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's",6607,42
"6608","former residence, and where she had lately learned that some",6608,42
"6609","acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen",6609,42
"6610","all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of",6610,42
"6611","Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It",6611,42
"6612","was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In",6612,42
"6613","talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an",6613,42
"6614","inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his",6614,42
"6615","willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.",6615,42
"6616","""My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so",6616,42
"6617","much?"" said her aunt. ""A place too, with which so many of your",6617,42
"6618","acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you",6618,42
"6619","know.""",6619,42
"6620","Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at",6620,42
"6621","Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She",6621,42
"6622","must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,",6622,42
"6623","she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.",6623,42
"6624","Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. ""If it were merely a fine house",6624,42
"6625","richly furnished,"" said she, ""I should not care about it myself; but the",6625,42
"6626","grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the",6626,42
"6627","country.""",6627,42
"6628","Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The",6628,42
"6629","possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly",6629,42
"6630","occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and",6630,42
"6631","thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run",6631,42
"6632","such a risk. But against this, there were objections; and she finally",6632,42
"6633","resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as",6633,42
"6634","to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.",6634,42
"6635","Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid",6635,42
"6636","whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its",6636,42
"6637","proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for",6637,42

"6659","Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned",6659,43
"6660","in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.",6660,43
"6661","The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They",6661,43
"6662","entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through",6662,43
"6663","a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.",6663,43
"6664","Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired",6664,43
"6665","every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for",6665,43
"6666","half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable",6666,43
"6667","eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by",6667,43
"6668","Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which",6668,43
"6669","the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone",6669,43
"6670","building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high",6670,43
"6671","woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was",6671,43
"6672","swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks",6672,43
"6673","were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She",6673,43
"6674","had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural",6674,43
"6675","beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were",6675,43
"6676","all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that",6676,43
"6677","to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!",6677,43
"6678","They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,",6678,43
"6679","while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of",6679,43
"6680","meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been",6680,43
"6681","mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the",6681,43
"6682","hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to",6682,43
"6683","wonder at her being where she was.",6683,43
"6684","The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less",6684,43
"6685","fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They",6685,43
"6686","followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned",6686,43
"6687","room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went",6687,43
"6688","to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from",6688,43
"6689","which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the",6689,43
"6690","distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was",6690,43
"6691","good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered",6691,43
"6692","on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace",6692,43
"6693","it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were",6693,43
"6694","taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to",6694,43
"6695","be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable",6695,43
"6696","to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration",6696,43
"6697","of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of",6697,43
"6698","splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.",6698,43
"6699","""And of this place,"" thought she, ""I might have been mistress! With",6699,43
"6700","these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of",6700,43
"6701","viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and",6701,43
"6702","welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,""--recollecting",6702,43
"6703","herself,--""that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost",6703,43

"6707","absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was",6707,43
"6708","asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds",6708,43
"6709","replied, that he was, adding, ""but we expect him to-morrow, with a",6709,43

"6780","of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the",6780,43

"6782","prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her",6782,43

"6795","""That is not very likely; our authority was too good.""",6795,43
"6796","On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very",6796,43

"6798","lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but",6798,43
"6799","just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the",6799,43
"6800","room, when last at Pemberley.",6800,43

"6809","but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already",6809,43
"6810","visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss",6810,43
"6811","Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and",6811,43
"6812","also more intelligible.",6812,43
"6813","In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have",6813,43
"6814","little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest",6814,43
"6815","of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it",6815,43
"6816","arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with",6816,43
"6817","such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,",6817,43
"6818","when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in",6818,43
"6819","earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the",6819,43
"6820","gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his",6820,43
"6821","father's life time.",6821,43
"6822","There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle",6822,43
"6823","sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of",6823,43
"6824","their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds",6824,43
"6825","was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise",6825,43
"6826","of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she",6826,43
"6827","considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How",6827,43
"6828","much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of",6828,43
"6829","good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought",6829,43
"6830","forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she",6830,43
"6831","stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes",6831,43
"6832","upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of",6832,43
"6833","gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and",6833,43
"6834","softened its impropriety of expression.",6834,43
"6835","When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,",6835,43
"6836","they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were",6836,43
"6837","consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.",6837,43
"6838","As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back",6838,43
"6839","to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was",6839,43
"6840","conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself",6840,43
"6841","suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.",6841,43
"6842","They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his",6842,43
"6843","appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes",6843,43
"6844","instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest",6844,43
"6845","blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from",6845,43
"6846","surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,",6846,43
"6847","and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least",6847,43
"6848","of perfect civility.",6848,43
"6849","She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,",6849,43
"6850","received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be",6850,43
"6851","overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture",6851,43
"6852","they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two",6852,43
"6853","that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on",6853,43
"6854","beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little",6854,43
"6855","aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,",6855,43
"6856","scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she",6856,43
"6857","returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the",6857,43
"6858","alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he",6858,43
"6859","uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the",6859,43
"6860","impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few",6860,43
"6861","minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most",6861,43
"6862","uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he",6862,43
"6863","spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his",6863,43
"6864","enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay",6864,43
"6865","in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the",6865,43
"6866","distraction of his thoughts.",6866,43
"6867","At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few",6867,43
"6868","moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took",6868,43
"6869","leave.",6869,43
"6870","The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his",6870,43
"6871","figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own",6871,43
"6872","feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and",6872,43
"6873","vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged",6873,43
"6874","thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a",6874,43
"6875","disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if",6875,43
"6876","she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?",6876,43
"6877","or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been",6877,43
"6878","only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his",6878,43
"6879","discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that",6879,43
"6880","moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and",6880,43
"6881","again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so",6881,43
"6882","strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to",6882,43
"6883","her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her",6883,43
"6884","family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,",6884,43
"6885","never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.",6885,43
"6886","What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when",6886,43
"6887","he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to",6887,43
"6888","account for it.",6888,43
"6889","They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and",6889,43
"6890","every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer",6890,43
"6891","reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time",6891,43
"6892","before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered",6892,43
"6893","mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed",6893,43
"6894","to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she",6894,43
"6895","distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that",6895,43
"6896","one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then",6896,43
"6897","was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in",6897,43
"6898","what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,",6898,43
"6899","she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he",6899,43
"6900","felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was",6900,43
"6901","not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing",6901,43
"6902","her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with",6902,43
"6903","composure.",6903,43
"6904","At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind",6904,43
"6905","roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",6905,43
"6906","They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,",6906,43
"6907","ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening",6907,43
"6908","of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of",6908,43
"6909","the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods",6909,43
"6910","overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner",6910,43
"6911","expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be",6911,43
"6912","beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten",6912,43
"6913","miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed",6913,43
"6914","circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among",6914,43
"6915","hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.",6915,43
"6916","They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of",6916,43
"6917","the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and",6917,43
"6918","the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the",6918,43
"6919","stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered",6919,43
"6920","it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed",6920,43
"6921","the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,",6921,43
"6922","who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of",6922,43
"6923","returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,",6923,43
"6924","therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house",6924,43
"6925","on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their",6925,43
"6926","progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the",6926,43
"6927","taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the",6927,43
"6928","occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man",6928,43
"6929","about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this",6929,43
"6930","slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was",6930,43
"6931","quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy",6931,43
"6932","approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less",6932,43
"6933","sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they",6933,43
"6934","met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an",6934,43
"6935","interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with",6935,43
"6936","calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,",6936,43
"6937","she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea",6937,43
"6938","lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the",6938,43
"6939","turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,",6939,43
"6940","that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his",6940,43
"6941","politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;",6941,43
"6942","but she had not got beyond the words ""delightful,"" and ""charming,"" when",6942,43
"6943","some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of",6943,43
"6944","Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour",6944,43
"6945","changed, and she said no more.",6945,43
"6946","Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked",6946,43
"6947","her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.",6947,43
"6948","This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and",6948,43
"6949","she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the",6949,43
"6950","acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had",6950,43
"6951","revolted, in his offer to herself. ""What will be his surprise,"" thought",6951,43
"6952","she, ""when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of",6952,43
"6953","fashion.""",6953,43
"6954","The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their",6954,43
"6955","relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore",6955,43
"6956","it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he",6956,43
"6957","could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the",6957,43
"6958","connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so",6958,43
"6959","far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into",6959,43
"6960","conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,",6960,43
"6961","could not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had",6961,43
"6962","some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most",6962,43
"6963","attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every",6963,43
"6964","expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,",6964,43
"6965","his taste, or his good manners.",6965,43
"6966","The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy",6966,43
"6967","invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he",6967,43
"6968","chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same",6968,43
"6969","time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of",6969,43
"6970","the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was",6970,43
"6971","walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her",6971,43
"6972","wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the",6972,43
"6973","compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was",6973,43
"6974","extreme; and continually was she repeating, ""Why is he so altered? From",6974,43
"6975","what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake",6975,43
"6976","that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not",6976,43
"6977","work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love",6977,43
"6978","me.""",6978,43
"6979","After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two",6979,43
"6980","gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the",6980,43
"6981","brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious",6981,43
"6982","water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in",6982,43
"6983","Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found",6983,43
"6984","Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred",6984,43
"6985","her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on",6985,43
"6986","together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to",6986,43
"6987","know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the",6987,43
"6988","place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been",6988,43
"6989","very unexpected--""for your housekeeper,"" she added, ""informed us that",6989,43
"6990","you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we",6990,43
"6991","left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in",6991,43
"6992","the country."" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that",6992,43
"6993","business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours",6993,43
"6994","before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. ""They",6994,43
"6995","will join me early to-morrow,"" he continued, ""and among them are some",6995,43
"6996","who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.""",6996,43
"6997","Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly",6997,43
"6998","driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned",6998,43
"6999","between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was",6999,43
"7000","not very differently engaged.",7000,43
"7001","""There is also one other person in the party,"" he continued after a",7001,43
"7002","pause, ""who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow",7002,43
"7003","me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance",7003,43
"7004","during your stay at Lambton?""",7004,43
"7005","The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great",7005,43
"7006","for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt",7006,43
"7007","that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,",7007,43
"7008","must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was",7008,43
"7009","satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made",7009,43
"7010","him think really ill of her.",7010,43
"7011","They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth",7011,43
"7012","was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and",7012,43
"7013","pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of",7013,43
"7014","the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had",7014,43
"7015","reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a",7015,43
"7016","mile behind.",7016,43
"7017","He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not",7017,43
"7018","tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might",7018,43
"7019","have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but",7019,43
"7020","there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that",7020,43
"7021","she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with",7021,43
"7022","great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience",7022,43
"7023","and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On",7023,43
"7024","Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the",7024,43
"7025","house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted",7025,43
"7026","on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies",7026,43
"7027","into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking",7027,43
"7028","slowly towards the house.",7028,43
"7029","The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them",7029,43
"7030","pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.",7030,43
"7031","""He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,"" said her uncle.",7031,43
"7032","""There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure,"" replied her",7032,43
"7033","aunt, ""but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now",7033,43
"7034","say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,",7034,43
"7035","_I_ have seen nothing of it.""",7035,43
"7036","""I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more",7036,43
"7037","than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such",7037,43
"7038","attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.""",7038,43
"7039","""To be sure, Lizzy,"" said her aunt, ""he is not so handsome as Wickham;",7039,43
"7040","or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are",7040,43
"7041","perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so",7041,43
"7042","disagreeable?""",7042,43
"7043","Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked",7043,43
"7044","him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never",7044,43
"7045","seen him so pleasant as this morning.",7045,43
"7046","""But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"" replied",7046,43
"7047","her uncle. ""Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him",7047,43
"7048","at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and",7048,43
"7049","warn me off his grounds.""",7049,43
"7050","Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said",7050,43
"7051","nothing.",7051,43
"7052","""From what we have seen of him,"" continued Mrs. Gardiner, ""I really",7052,43
"7053","should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by",7053,43
"7054","any body, as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured",7054,43
"7055","look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when",7055,43
"7056","he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that",7056,43
"7057","would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure,",7057,43
"7058","the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming",7058,43
"7059","character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a",7059,43
"7060","liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant",7060,43
"7061","comprehends every virtue.""",7061,43
"7062","Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of",7062,43
"7063","his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as",7063,43
"7064","guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his",7064,43
"7065","relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different",7065,43
"7066","construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor",7066,43
"7067","Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In",7067,43
"7068","confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary",7068,43
"7069","transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming",7069,43
"7070","her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.",7070,43
"7071","Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now",7071,43
"7072","approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to",7072,43
"7073","the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out",7073,43
"7074","to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of",7074,43
"7075","any thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had",7075,43
"7076","no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former",7076,43
"7077","acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an",7077,43
"7078","intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.",7078,43
"7079","The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth",7079,43
"7080","much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing",7080,43
"7081","but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above",7081,43
"7082","all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.",7082,43
"7083","Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit",7083,44
"7084","her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently",7084,44
"7085","resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.",7085,44
"7086","But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own",7086,44
"7087","arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the",7087,44
"7088","place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn",7088,44
"7089","to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a",7089,44
"7090","carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a",7090,44
"7091","curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the",7091,44
"7092","livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise",7092,44
"7093","to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she",7093,44
"7094","expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment",7094,44
"7095","of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many",7095,44
"7096","of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on",7096,44
"7097","the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt",7097,44
"7098","that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such",7098,44
"7099","a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these",7099,44
"7100","newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of",7100,44
"7101","Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed",7101,44
"7102","at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she",7102,44
"7103","dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in",7103,44
"7104","her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally",7104,44
"7105","suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.",7105,44
"7106","She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked",7106,44
"7107","up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks",7107,44
"7108","of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.",7108,44
"7109","Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction",7109,44
"7110","took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new",7110,44
"7111","acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her",7111,44
"7112","being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;",7112,44
"7113","but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was",7113,44
"7114","only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from",7114,44
"7115","her beyond a monosyllable.",7115,44
"7116","Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though",7116,44
"7117","little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance",7117,44
"7118","womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there",7118,44
"7119","was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly",7119,44
"7120","unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as",7120,44
"7121","acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much",7121,44
"7122","relieved by discerning such different feelings.",7122,44
"7123","They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was",7123,44
"7124","also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her",7124,44
"7125","satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step",7125,44
"7126","was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All",7126,44
"7127","Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she",7127,44
"7128","still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the",7128,44
"7129","unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her",7129,44
"7130","again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,",7130,44
"7131","and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever",7131,44
"7132","done.",7132,44
"7133","To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage",7133,44
"7134","than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before",7134,44
"7135","them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just",7135,44
"7136","arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards",7136,44
"7137","each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from",7137,44
"7138","those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what",7138,44
"7139","it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in",7139,44
"7140","doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was",7140,44
"7141","evident enough.",7141,44
"7142","Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the",7142,44
"7143","feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to",7143,44
"7144","make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she",7144,44
"7145","feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she",7145,44
"7146","endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley",7146,44
"7147","was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.",7147,44
"7148","In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!",7148,44
"7149","how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a",7149,44
"7150","like manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on",7150,44
"7151","former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that",7151,44
"7152","as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though",7152,44
"7153","this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour",7153,44
"7154","to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared",7154,44
"7155","on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between",7155,44
"7156","them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was",7156,44
"7157","soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they",7157,44
"7158","parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of",7158,44
"7159","Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that",7159,44
"7160","might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a",7160,44
"7161","moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had",7161,44
"7162","something of real regret, that it ""was a very long time since he had had",7162,44
"7163","the pleasure of seeing her;"" and, before she could reply, he added, ""It",7163,44
"7164","is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when",7164,44
"7165","we were all dancing together at Netherfield.""",7165,44
"7166","Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards",7166,44
"7167","took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,",7167,44
"7168","whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the",7168,44
"7169","question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner",7169,44
"7170","which gave them meaning.",7170,44
"7171","It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,",7171,44
"7172","whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general",7172,44
"7173","complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far",7173,44
"7174","removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that",7174,44
"7175","the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however",7175,44
"7176","temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When",7176,44
"7177","she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion",7177,44
"7178","of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a",7178,44
"7179","disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the",7179,44
"7180","very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last",7180,44
"7181","lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so",7181,44
"7182","great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly",7182,44
"7183","restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company",7183,44
"7184","of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at",7184,44
"7185","Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from",7185,44
"7186","self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could",7186,44
"7187","result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the",7187,44
"7188","acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw",7188,44
"7189","down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and",7189,44
"7190","Rosings.",7190,44
"7191","Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose",7191,44
"7192","to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing",7192,44
"7193","their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner",7193,44
"7194","at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a",7194,44
"7195","diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,",7195,44
"7196","readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing",7196,44
"7197","how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its",7197,44
"7198","acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,",7198,44
"7199","that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than",7199,44
"7200","any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of",7200,44
"7201","society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for",7201,44
"7202","her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",7202,44
"7203","Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth",7203,44
"7204","again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to",7204,44
"7205","make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all",7205,44
"7206","this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on",7206,44
"7207","this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors",7207,44
"7208","left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some",7208,44
"7209","satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been",7209,44
"7210","little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her",7210,44
"7211","uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their",7211,44
"7212","favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",7212,44
"7213","But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was",7213,44
"7214","not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was",7214,44
"7215","much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;",7215,44
"7216","it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to",7216,44
"7217","interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.",7217,44
"7218","Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far",7218,44
"7219","as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could",7219,44
"7220","not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character",7220,44
"7221","from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference",7221,44
"7222","to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,",7222,44
"7223","would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,",7223,44
"7224","however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,",7224,44
"7225","that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four",7225,44
"7226","years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be",7226,44
"7227","hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of",7227,44
"7228","their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They",7228,44
"7229","had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if",7229,44
"7230","not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small",7230,44
"7231","market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,",7231,44
"7232","however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.",7232,44
"7233","With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held",7233,44
"7234","there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the",7234,44
"7235","son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known",7235,44
"7236","fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind",7236,44
"7237","him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",7237,44
"7238","As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than",7238,44
"7239","the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not",7239,44
"7240","long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and",7240,44
"7241","she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She",7241,44
"7242","certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she",7242,44
"7243","had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,",7243,44
"7244","that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his",7244,44
"7245","valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some",7245,44
"7246","time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened",7246,44
"7247","into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his",7247,44
"7248","favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,",7248,44
"7249","which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,",7249,44
"7250","there was a motive within her of good will which could not be",7250,44
"7251","overlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once",7251,44
"7252","loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the",7252,44
"7253","petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the",7253,44
"7254","unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been",7254,44
"7255","persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this",7255,44
"7256","accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without",7256,44
"7257","any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where",7257,44
"7258","their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion",7258,44
"7259","of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a",7259,44
"7260","change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but",7260,44
"7261","gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such",7261,44
"7262","its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means",7262,44
"7263","unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she",7263,44
"7264","esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his",7264,44
"7265","welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to",7265,44
"7266","depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both",7266,44
"7267","that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still",7267,44
"7268","possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",7268,44
"7269","It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that",7269,44
"7270","such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very",7270,44
"7271","day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late",7271,44
"7272","breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by",7272,44
"7273","some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it",7273,44
"7274","would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following",7274,44
"7275","morning. They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,",7275,44
"7276","when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.",7276,44
"7277","Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been",7277,44
"7278","renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting",7278,44
"7279","some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.",7279,44
"7280","Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had",7280,45
"7281","originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome",7281,45
"7282","her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with",7282,45
"7283","how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be",7283,45
"7284","renewed.",7284,45
"7285","On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,",7285,45
"7286","whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows",7286,45
"7287","opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody",7287,45
"7288","hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts",7288,45
"7289","which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.",7289,45
"7290","In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there",7290,45
"7291","with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in",7291,45
"7292","London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with",7292,45
"7293","all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the",7293,45
"7294","fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves",7294,45
"7295","inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and",7295,45
"7296","her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.",7296,45
"7297","By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and",7297,45
"7298","on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,",7298,45
"7299","succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a",7299,45
"7300","genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind",7300,45
"7301","of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the",7301,45
"7302","others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from",7302,45
"7303","Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she",7303,45
"7304","wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a",7304,45
"7305","short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.",7305,45
"7306","Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,",7306,45
"7307","and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without",7307,45
"7308","calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her",7308,45
"7309","from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an",7309,45
"7310","inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity",7310,45
"7311","of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every",7311,45
"7312","moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she",7312,45
"7313","feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether",7313,45
"7314","she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After",7314,45
"7315","sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss",7315,45
"7316","Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold",7316,45
"7317","enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal",7317,45
"7318","indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.",7318,45
"7319","The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the",7319,45
"7320","entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the",7320,45
"7321","finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a",7321,45
"7322","significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been",7322,45
"7323","given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole",7323,45
"7324","party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the",7324,45
"7325","beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected",7325,45
"7326","them round the table.",7326,45
"7327","While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether",7327,45
"7328","she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the",7328,45
"7329","feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but",7329,45
"7330","a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to",7330,45
"7331","regret that he came.",7331,45
"7332","He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other",7332,45
"7333","gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him",7333,45
"7334","only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to",7334,45
"7335","Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely",7335,45
"7336","resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more",7336,45
"7337","necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she",7337,45
"7338","saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,",7338,45
"7339","and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour",7339,45
"7340","when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive",7340,45
"7341","curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the",7341,45
"7342","smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its",7342,45
"7343","objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions",7343,45
"7344","to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's",7344,45
"7345","entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he",7345,45
"7346","was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,",7346,45
"7347","as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss",7347,45
"7348","Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the",7348,45
"7349","first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,",7349,45
"7350","""Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?",7350,45
"7351","They must be a great loss to _your_ family.""",7351,45
"7352","In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth",7352,45
"7353","instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the",7353,45
"7354","various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;",7354,45
"7355","but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she",7355,45
"7356","presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While",7356,45
"7357","she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened",7357,45
"7358","complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with",7358,45
"7359","confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what",7359,45
"7360","pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have",7360,45
"7361","refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose",7361,45
"7362","Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed",7362,45
"7363","her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in",7363,45
"7364","Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and",7364,45
"7365","absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that",7365,45
"7366","corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated",7366,45
"7367","elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was",7367,45
"7368","possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her",7368,45
"7369","brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish",7369,45
"7370","which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming",7370,45
"7371","hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without",7371,45
"7372","meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss",7372,45
"7373","Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern",7373,45
"7374","for the welfare of his friend.",7374,45
"7375","Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and",7375,45
"7376","as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to",7376,45
"7377","Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able",7377,45
"7378","to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely",7378,45
"7379","recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which",7379,45
"7380","had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have",7380,45
"7381","fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.",7381,45
"7382","Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer",7382,45
"7383","above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their",7383,45
"7384","carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on",7384,45
"7385","Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join",7385,45
"7386","her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his",7386,45
"7387","judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as",7387,45
"7388","to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than",7388,45
"7389","lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley",7389,45
"7390","could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to",7390,45
"7391","his sister.",7391,45
"7392","""How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"" she cried; ""I",7392,45
"7393","never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.",7393,45
"7394","She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we",7394,45
"7395","should not have known her again.""",7395,45
"7396","However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented",7396,45
"7397","himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than",7397,45
"7398","her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the",7398,45
"7399","summer.",7399,45
"7400","""For my own part,"" she rejoined, ""I must confess that I never could see",7400,45
"7401","any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no",7401,45
"7402","brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants",7402,45
"7403","character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are",7403,45
"7404","tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which",7404,45
"7405","have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing",7405,45
"7406","extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not",7406,45
"7407","like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency",7407,45
"7408","without fashion, which is intolerable.""",7408,45
"7409","Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not",7409,45
"7410","the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always",7410,45
"7411","wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the",7411,45
"7412","success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a",7412,45
"7413","determination of making him speak, she continued,",7413,45
"7414","""I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all",7414,45
"7415","were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect",7415,45
"7416","your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_",7416,45
"7417","a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she",7417,45

"7419","one time.""",7419,45
"7420","""Yes,"" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, ""but _that_",7420,45

"7422","considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.""",7422,45
"7423","He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of",7423,45
"7424","having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.",7424,45
"7425","Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during",7425,45

"7428","discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.",7428,45

"7435","been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but",7435,46
"7436","on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the",7436,46
"7437","receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that",7437,46

"7504","against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,",7504,46
"7505","can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to",7505,46
"7506","find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their",7506,46
"7507","marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he",7507,46
"7508","feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill",7508,46
"7509","and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but",7509,46
"7510","this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life",7510,46
"7511","saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed",7511,46
"7512","their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot",7512,46
"7513","wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared",7513,46
"7514","something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock",7514,46
"7515","is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so",7515,46
"7516","selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I",7516,46
"7517","take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,",7517,46
"7518","but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging",7518,46
"7519","you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and",7519,46
"7520","aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have",7520,46
"7521","still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to",7521,46
"7522","London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What",7522,46
"7523","he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress",7523,46
"7524","will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest",7524,46
"7525","way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again",7525,46
"7526","to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and",7526,46
"7527","assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately",7527,46
"7528","comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""",7528,46
"7529","""Oh! where, where is my uncle?"" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat",7529,46
"7530","as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a",7530,46
"7531","moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was",7531,46
"7532","opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous",7532,46
"7533","manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to",7533,46
"7534","speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's",7534,46
"7535","situation, hastily exclaimed, ""I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.",7535,46
"7536","I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be",7536,46
"7537","delayed; I have not an instant to lose.""",7537,46
"7538","""Good God! what is the matter?"" cried he, with more feeling than",7538,46
"7539","politeness; then recollecting himself, ""I will not detain you a minute,",7539,46
"7540","but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are",7540,46
"7541","not well enough;--you cannot go yourself.""",7541,46
"7542","Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how",7542,46
"7543","little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back",7543,46
"7544","the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an",7544,46
"7545","accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and",7545,46
"7546","mistress home, instantly.",7546,46
"7547","On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and",7547,46
"7548","looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,",7548,46
"7549","or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,",7549,46
"7550","""Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you",7550,46
"7551","present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very",7551,46
"7552","ill.""",7552,46
"7553","""No, I thank you;"" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. ""There",7553,46
"7554","is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by",7554,46
"7555","some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.""",7555,46
"7556","She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could",7556,46
"7557","not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say",7557,46
"7558","something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate",7558,46
"7559","silence. At length, she spoke again. ""I have just had a letter from",7559,46
"7560","Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My",7560,46
"7561","youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown",7561,46
"7562","herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together",7562,46
"7563","from Brighton. _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no",7563,46
"7564","money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for",7564,46
"7565","ever.""",7565,46
"7566","Darcy was fixed in astonishment. ""When I consider,"" she added, in a yet",7566,46
"7567","more agitated voice, ""that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew",7567,46
"7568","what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what",7568,46
"7569","I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not",7569,46
"7570","have happened. But it is all, all too late now.""",7570,46
"7571","""I am grieved, indeed,"" cried Darcy; ""grieved--shocked. But is it",7571,46
"7572","certain, absolutely certain?""",7572,46
"7573","""Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced",7573,46
"7574","almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to",7574,46
"7575","Scotland.""",7575,46
"7576","""And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?""",7576,46
"7577","""My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's",7577,46
"7578","immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But",7578,46
"7579","nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is",7579,46
"7580","such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have",7580,46
"7581","not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!""",7581,46
"7582","Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.",7582,46
"7583","""When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what",7583,46
"7584","I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too",7584,46
"7585","much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!""",7585,46
"7586","Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up",7586,46
"7587","and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air",7587,46
"7588","gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power",7588,46
"7589","was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family",7589,46
"7590","weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither",7590,46
"7591","wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing",7591,46
"7592","consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It",7592,46
"7593","was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own",7593,46
"7594","wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved",7594,46
"7595","him, as now, when all love must be vain.",7595,46
"7596","But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the",7596,46
"7597","humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up",7597,46
"7598","every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,",7598,46
"7599","Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of",7599,46
"7600","several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the",7600,46
"7601","voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke",7601,46
"7602","compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, ""I am afraid you have been",7602,46
"7603","long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my",7603,46
"7604","stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any",7604,46
"7605","thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer",7605,46
"7606","consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain",7606,46
"7607","wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This",7607,46
"7608","unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure",7608,46
"7609","of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.""",7609,46
"7610","""Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that",7610,46
"7611","urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as",7611,46
"7612","long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long.""",7612,46
"7613","He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for",7613,46
"7614","her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present",7614,46
"7615","reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only",7615,46
"7616","one serious, parting, look, went away.",7616,46
"7617","As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they",7617,46
"7618","should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had",7618,46
"7619","marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a",7619,46
"7620","retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of",7620,46
"7621","contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those",7621,46
"7622","feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would",7622,46
"7623","formerly have rejoiced in its termination.",7623,46
"7624","If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's",7624,46
"7625","change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if",7625,46
"7626","otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or",7626,46
"7627","unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a",7627,46
"7628","first interview with its object, and even before two words have been",7628,46
"7629","exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given",7629,46
"7630","somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,",7630,46
"7631","and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other",7631,46
"7632","less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go",7632,46
"7633","with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must",7633,46
"7634","produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched",7634,46
"7635","business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained",7635,46
"7636","a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,",7636,46
"7637","could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least",7637,46
"7638","of her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first",7638,46
"7639","letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that",7639,46
"7640","Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for",7640,46
"7641","money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared",7641,46
"7642","incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment",7642,46
"7643","as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not",7643,46
"7644","suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the",7644,46
"7645","intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither",7645,46
"7646","her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy",7646,46
"7647","prey.",7647,46
"7648","She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that",7648,46
"7649","Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had",7649,46
"7650","wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one",7650,46
"7651","officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions",7651,46
"7652","raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually",7652,46
"7653","fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and",7653,46
"7654","mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now",7654,46
"7655","feel it.",7655,46
"7656","She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to",7656,46
"7657","share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a",7657,46
"7658","family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and",7658,46
"7659","requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing",7659,46
"7660","could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost",7660,46
"7661","importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience",7661,46
"7662","was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,",7662,46
"7663","by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but",7663,46
"7664","satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the",7664,46
"7665","cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on",7665,46
"7666","the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had",7666,46
"7667","never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be",7667,46
"7668","deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after",7668,46
"7669","the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily",7669,46
"7670","promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no",7670,46
"7671","less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated",7671,46
"7672","by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily",7672,46
"7673","settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. ""But what is to be",7673,46
"7674","done about Pemberley?"" cried Mrs. Gardiner. ""John told us Mr. Darcy was",7674,46
"7675","here when you sent for us;--was it so?""",7675,46
"7676","""Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.",7676,46
"7677","_That_ is all settled.""",7677,46
"7678","""That is all settled;"" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to",7678,46
"7679","prepare. ""And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real",7679,46
"7680","truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!""",7680,46
"7681","But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the",7681,46
"7682","hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure",7682,46
"7683","to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was",7683,46
"7684","impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of",7684,46
"7685","business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to",7685,46
"7686","be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their",7686,46
"7687","sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.",7687,46
"7688","Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing",7688,46
"7689","remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of",7689,46
"7690","the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could",7690,46
"7691","have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.",7691,46
"7692","""I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"" said her uncle, as they",7692,47
"7693","drove from the town; ""and really, upon serious consideration, I am much",7693,47
"7694","more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the",7694,47
"7695","matter. It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should",7695,47
"7696","form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or",7696,47
"7697","friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I",7697,47
"7698","am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends",7698,47
"7699","would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the",7699,47
"7700","regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is",7700,47
"7701","not adequate to the risk.""",7701,47
"7702","""Do you really think so?"" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.",7702,47
"7703","""Upon my word,"" said Mrs. Gardiner, ""I begin to be of your uncle's",7703,47
"7704","opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and",7704,47
"7705","interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of",7705,47
"7706","Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe",7706,47
"7707","him capable of it?""",7707,47
"7708","""Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect",7708,47
"7709","I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not",7709,47
"7710","hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the",7710,47
"7711","case?""",7711,47
"7712","""In the first place,"" replied Mr. Gardiner, ""there is no absolute proof",7712,47
"7713","that they are not gone to Scotland.""",7713,47
"7714","""Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a",7714,47
"7715","presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the",7715,47
"7716","Barnet road.""",7716,47
"7717","""Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though",7717,47
"7718","for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is",7718,47
"7719","not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it",7719,47
"7720","might strike them that they could be more economically, though less",7720,47
"7721","expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.""",7721,47
"7722","""But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their",7722,47
"7723","marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular",7723,47
"7724","friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending",7724,47
"7725","to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He",7725,47
"7726","cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she",7726,47
"7727","beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,",7727,47
"7728","forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what",7728,47
"7729","restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a",7729,47
"7730","dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know",7730,47
"7731","nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your",7731,47
"7732","other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no",7732,47
"7733","brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's",7733,47
"7734","behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever",7734,47
"7735","seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would",7735,47
"7736","do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in",7736,47
"7737","such a matter.""",7737,47
"7738","""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,",7738,47
"7739","as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?""",7739,47
"7740","""It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, with",7740,47
"7741","tears in her eyes, ""that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such",7741,47
"7742","a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.",7742,47
"7743","Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never",7743,47
"7744","been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,",7744,47
"7745","nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement",7745,47
"7746","and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle",7746,47

"7751","greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are",7751,47
"7752","naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of",7752,47
"7753","person and address that can captivate a woman.""",7753,47
"7754","""But you see that Jane,"" said her aunt, ""does not think so ill of",7754,47

"8290","moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your",8290,49
"8291","life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions, which,",8291,49
"8292","considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as",8292,49
"8293","far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by",8293,49
"8294","express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You",8294,49
"8295","will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's",8295,49
"8296","circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to",8296,49
"8297","be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to",8297,49
"8298","say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are",8298,49
"8299","discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.",8299,49
"8300","If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act",8300,49

"8346","Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued",8346,49
"8347","silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the",8347,49
"8348","library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.",8348,49
"8349","""And they are really to be married!"" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they",8349,49
"8350","were by themselves. ""How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be",8350,49
"8351","thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,",8351,49

"8355","uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten",8355,49
"8356","thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. He has",8356,49

"8362","not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be",8362,49
"8363","requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal",8363,49
"8364","protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as",8364,49
"8365","years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is",8365,49
"8366","actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,",8366,49

"8371","her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of",8371,49
"8372","thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself",8372,49

"8377","It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood",8377,49
"8378","perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,",8378,49
"8379","therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to",8379,49
"8380","make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head,",8380,49

"8385","Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up",8385,49
"8386","stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one",8386,49
"8387","communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation",8387,49
"8388","for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly",8388,49
"8389","contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's",8389,49
"8390","being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence",8390,49
"8391","added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from",8391,49
"8392","delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know",8392,49
"8393","that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no",8393,49
"8394","fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.",8394,49
"8395","""My dear, dear Lydia!"" she cried: ""This is delightful indeed!--She will",8395,49
"8396","be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My",8396,49

"8399","clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about",8399,49

"8401","much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,",8401,49
"8402","Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear",8402,49
"8403","Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!""",8403,49
"8404","Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of",8404,49
"8405","these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.",8405,49
"8406","Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.",8406,49
"8407","""For we must attribute this happy conclusion,"" she added, ""in a great",8407,49
"8408","measure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself",8408,49
"8409","to assist Mr. Wickham with money.""",8409,49
"8410","""Well,"" cried her mother, ""it is all very right; who should do it but",8410,49
"8411","her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children",8411,49
"8412","must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have",8412,49

"8416","such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you",8416,49
"8417","write for me. We will settle with your father about the money",8417,49
"8418","afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.""",8418,49
"8419","She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and",8419,49
"8420","cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had",8420,49
"8421","not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her",8421,49
"8422","father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay she observed,",8422,49
"8423","would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite",8423,49
"8424","so obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.",8424,49
"8425","""I will go to Meryton,"" said she, ""as soon as I am dressed, and tell the",8425,49
"8426","good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on",8426,49
"8427","Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An",8427,49
"8428","airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do any",8428,49
"8429","thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you",8429,49
"8430","heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall",8430,49
"8431","all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding.""",8431,49
"8432","Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her",8432,49
"8433","congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took",8433,49
"8434","refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.",8434,49
"8435","Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no",8435,49
"8436","worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in",8436,49
"8437","looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,",8437,49
"8438","could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they",8438,49
"8439","had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they",8439,49
"8440","had gained.",8440,49
"8441","Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,",8441,50
"8442","instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for",8442,50
"8443","the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived",8443,50
"8444","him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that",8444,50
"8445","respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of",8445,50
"8446","honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of",8446,50
"8447","prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be",8447,50
"8448","her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.",8448,50
"8449","He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any",8449,50
"8450","one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and",8450,50
"8451","he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his",8451,50
"8452","assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.",8452,50
"8453","When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly",8453,50
"8454","useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join",8454,50
"8455","in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow",8455,50
"8456","and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters",8456,50
"8457","successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.",8457,50
"8458","Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he",8458,50
"8459","would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too",8459,50
"8460","late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her",8460,50
"8461","husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their",8461,50
"8462","income.",8462,50
"8463","Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and",8463,50
"8464","the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the",8464,50
"8465","latter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with",8465,50
"8466","regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet",8466,50
"8467","could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In",8467,50
"8468","terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though",8468,50
"8469","expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect",8469,50
"8470","approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the",8470,50
"8471","engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed",8471,50
"8472","that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be",8472,50
"8473","done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present",8473,50
"8474","arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the",8474,50
"8475","hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket",8475,50
"8476","allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,",8476,50
"8477","through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within",8477,50
"8478","that sum.",8478,50
"8479","That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was",8479,50
"8480","another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to",8480,50
"8481","have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first",8481,50
"8482","transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were",8482,50
"8483","over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was",8483,50
"8484","soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was",8484,50
"8485","quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he",8485,50
"8486","was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any",8486,50
"8487","message to her.",8487,50
"8488","The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate",8488,50
"8489","speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent",8489,50
"8490","philosophy. To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of",8490,50
"8491","conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the",8491,50
"8492","happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm",8492,50
"8493","house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the",8493,50
"8494","good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from",8494,50
"8495","all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit",8495,50
"8496","in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her",8496,50
"8497","misery was considered certain.",8497,50
"8498","It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this",8498,50
"8499","happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in",8499,50
"8500","spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her",8500,50
"8501","triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of",8501,50
"8502","her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of",8502,50
"8503","accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those",8503,50
"8504","attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and",8504,50
"8505","servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a",8505,50
"8506","proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering",8506,50
"8507","what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and",8507,50
"8508","importance.",8508,50
"8509","""Haye-Park might do,"" said she, ""if the Gouldings would quit it, or the",8509,50
"8510","great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is",8510,50
"8511","too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for",8511,50
"8512","Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.""",8512,50
"8513","Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the",8513,50
"8514","servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, ""Mrs.",8514,50
"8515","Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and",8515,50
"8516","daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this",8516,50
"8517","neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage",8517,50
"8518","the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.""",8518,50
"8519","A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it",8519,50
"8520","soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,",8520,50
"8521","that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his",8521,50
"8522","daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of",8522,50
"8523","affection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend",8523,50
"8524","it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable",8524,50
"8525","resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her",8525,50
"8526","marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe",8526,50
"8527","possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new",8527,50
"8528","clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of",8528,50
"8529","shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they",8529,50
"8530","took place.",8530,50
"8531","Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of",8531,50
"8532","the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for",8532,50
"8533","her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper",8533,50
"8534","termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its",8534,50
"8535","unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the",8535,50
"8536","spot.",8536,50
"8537","She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were",8537,50
"8538","few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;",8538,50
"8539","but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's",8539,50
"8540","frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of",8540,50
"8541","disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there",8541,50
"8542","seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been",8542,50
"8543","concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that",8543,50
"8544","Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other",8544,50
"8545","objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the",8545,50
"8546","nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.",8546,50

"8549","feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a",8549,50
"8550","blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she",8550,50
"8551","hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no",8551,50
"8552","longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there",8552,50
"8553","seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that",8553,50
"8554","she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they",8554,50
"8555","should meet.",8555,50
"8556","What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the",8556,50
"8557","proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now",8557,50
"8558","have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she",8558,50
"8559","doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,",8559,50
"8560","there must be a triumph.",8560,50
"8561","She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in",8561,50
"8562","disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and",8562,50
"8563","temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It",8563,50
"8564","was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease",8564,50
"8565","and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,",8565,50
"8566","and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must",8566,50
"8567","have received benefit of greater importance.",8567,50
"8568","But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what",8568,50
"8569","connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and",8569,50
"8570","precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their",8570,50
"8571","family.",8571,50
"8572","How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,",8572,50
"8573","she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could",8573,50
"8574","belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions",8574,50
"8575","were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.",8575,50

"8813","hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be",8813,52
"8814","interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be",8814,52
"8815","happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not",8815,52

"8818","""MY DEAR NIECE,",8818,52
"8819","""I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole",8819,52
"8820","morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will",8820,52
"8821","not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself",8821,52
"8822","surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.",8822,52
"8823","Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,",8823,52
"8824","that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_",8824,52
"8825","side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my",8825,52
"8826","impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing",8826,52
"8827","but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed",8827,52
"8828","him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and",8828,52
"8829","ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming",8829,52
"8830","home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.",8830,52
"8831","Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all",8831,52
"8832","over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked",8832,52
"8833","as _your's_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that",8833,52
"8834","he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that",8834,52
"8835","he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia",8835,52
"8836","once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day",8836,52
"8837","after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting",8837,52
"8838","for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being",8838,52
"8839","owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well",8839,52
"8840","known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,",8840,52
"8841","to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his",8841,52
"8842","mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath",8842,52
"8843","him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character",8843,52
"8844","was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step",8844,52
"8845","forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on",8845,52
"8846","by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never",8846,52
"8847","disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to",8847,52
"8848","discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was",8848,52
"8849","more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another",8849,52
"8850","reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a",8850,52
"8851","Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was",8851,52
"8852","dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though",8852,52
"8853","he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,",8853,52
"8854","and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.",8854,52
"8855","Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he",8855,52
"8856","went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But",8856,52
"8857","it was two or three days before he could get from her what he",8857,52
"8858","wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery",8858,52
"8859","and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be",8859,52
"8860","found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in",8860,52
"8861","London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they",8861,52
"8862","would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our",8862,52
"8863","kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----",8863,52
"8864","street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.",8864,52
"8865","His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade",8865,52
"8866","her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her",8866,52
"8867","friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,",8867,52
"8868","offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia",8868,52
"8869","absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none",8869,52
"8870","of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of",8870,52
"8871","leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or",8871,52
"8872","other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her",8872,52
"8873","feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a",8873,52
"8874","marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he",8874,52
"8875","easily learnt, had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself",8875,52
"8876","obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,",8876,52
"8877","which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the",8877,52
"8878","ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone. He",8878,52
"8879","meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future",8879,52
"8880","situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go",8880,52
"8881","somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have",8881,52
"8882","nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your",8882,52
"8883","sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,",8883,52
"8884","he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation",8884,52
"8885","must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to",8885,52
"8886","this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more",8886,52
"8887","effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.",8887,52
"8888","Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof",8888,52
"8889","against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,",8889,52
"8890","for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more",8890,52
"8891","than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.",8891,52
"8892","Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was",8892,52
"8893","to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in",8893,52
"8894","Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner",8894,52
"8895","could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that",8895,52
"8896","your father was still with him, but would quit town the next",8896,52
"8897","morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could",8897,52
"8898","so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed",8898,52
"8899","seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not",8899,52
"8900","leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a",8900,52
"8901","gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your",8901,52
"8902","father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they",8902,52
"8903","had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and",8903,52
"8904","then _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon",8904,52
"8905","as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor",8905,52
"8906","was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real",8906,52
"8907","defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many",8907,52
"8908","faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was",8908,52
"8909","to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do",8909,52
"8910","not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your",8910,52
"8911","uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it",8911,52
"8912","together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman",8912,52
"8913","or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced",8913,52
"8914","to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,",8914,52
"8915","was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,",8915,52
"8916","which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your",8916,52
"8917","letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an",8917,52
"8918","explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give",8918,52
"8919","the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther",8919,52
"8920","than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose,",8920,52
"8921","what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,",8921,52
"8922","amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,",8922,52
"8923","another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his",8923,52
"8924","commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him",8924,52
"8925","alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his",8925,52
"8926","reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character",8926,52
"8927","had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been",8927,52
"8928","received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in",8928,52
"8929","_this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_",8929,52
"8930","reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this",8930,52
"8931","fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that",8931,52
"8932","your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit",8932,52
"8933","for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved",8933,52
"8934","on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at",8934,52
"8935","Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more",8935,52
"8936","when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to",8936,52
"8937","receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing.",8937,52
"8938","It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I",8938,52
"8939","hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to",8939,52
"8940","us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was",8940,52
"8941","exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I",8941,52
"8942","would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour",8942,52
"8943","while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter",8943,52
"8944","last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a",8944,52
"8945","piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no",8945,52
"8946","fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,",8946,52
"8947","representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and",8947,52
"8948","all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,",8948,52
"8949","it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was",8949,52
"8950","sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth",8950,52
"8951","and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was",8951,52
"8952","punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the",8952,52
"8953","wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again",8953,52
"8954","on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear",8954,52
"8955","Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold",8955,52
"8956","enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,",8956,52
"8957","in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.",8957,52
"8958","His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but",8958,52
"8959","a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his",8959,52
"8960","wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever",8960,52
"8961","mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive",8961,52
"8962","me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so",8962,52
"8963","far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I",8963,52
"8964","have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little",8964,52
"8965","pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more.",8965,52

"8969","The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,",8969,52
"8970","in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the",8970,52
"8971","greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had",8971,52
"8972","produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's",8972,52
"8973","match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too",8973,52
"8974","great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the",8974,52
"8975","pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!",8975,52
"8976","He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the",8976,52
"8977","trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which",8977,52
"8978","supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and",8978,52

"8980","persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to",8980,52
"8981","avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had",8981,52
"8982","done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her",8982,52
"8983","heart did whisper, that he had done it for her. But it was a hope",8983,52
"8984","shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her",8984,52
"8985","vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for",8985,52
"8986","her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a",8986,52

"8991","extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel",8991,52
"8992","he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising",8992,52
"8993","it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,",8993,52

"8997","they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a",8997,52
